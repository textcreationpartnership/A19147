         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any can witnes (deerely beloued in our Sauiour) how willing I was to ſurceaſe, and did in deede breake off, when I had compoſed the one halfe of the treatiſe enſuing, holding then, the proceeding therein a labour and charge needleſſe, becauſe foure of our brethren were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Rome</hi> for his Holines deciſion, and end in the controuerſie. But in this ſuſpence of minde, and intermiſſion of the worke, our Arch-prieſt on the 26. of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary laſt, promulgated the Popes Breue of the 17. of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt next before, after he had kept the ſame three months or longer in his hands, as it is ſayd. In which Breue, both we were demaunded <hi>what cauſe we had, why we did not obey the Cardinall Protectors letters erecting the ſubordination,</hi> &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therein giuen: <hi>That doubtleſſe, we ought to haue obeyed, and admitted the authoritye.</hi> Which <hi>demaund and iudgement,</hi> beſide many other places in the Breue, were euident argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnto vs, that the ſame was graunted vpon wrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and <note n="a" place="margin">Ca. ſi 15. de fil praesb. li. 6. &amp; ca. ſi motu proprio de praebend. li. 6.</note> conſequently of no ſufficient force to bind. For had his Holines or the Cardinall Praefect of the Breues, bin truly informed of the caſe, neither his Holines, nor the Cardinall would without peraduenture euer haue made ſuch a demaund, or giuen like ſentence againſt vs. And as litle would either of their ſacred perſons, haue omitted to comprehend the Ieſuites vnder the cenſure of the Breue,
<pb facs="tcp:16974:5"/> or letted to reproue their fault, had they knowne that the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites were the prime authors, the only ſtiffe maintainers, and reuiuers of the crime againſt vs. Moreouer, at the very time of the promulgation of the Breue, there came forth firſt the Apollogie and then the Appendixe <hi>with licence of our Archprieſt, as written by the vnited Prieſtes in due ſubordination vnto him:</hi> books that moſt ſharply inueigh againſt vs, for not receiuing the authoritie at firſt, vpon ſight of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue letter. For which cauſes, and for that ſundrie perſons of good place, haue of late affirmed, that Fa. <hi>Liſter</hi> could and would defend his poſition of our ſchiſme againſt any ſcholler in the world, and alſo becauſe certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fauorites of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites hold opinion, that the Breue doth not cleere vs from ſchiſme, but leaueth it doubtfull and vndecided; and finally, for that ſome of their moſt deuoted, are ſo ful ſpirited, as they ſticke not to report, that the cauſe why the Pope declared in the maner he hath done for vs, was not for that our cauſe was iuſt, but vpon a prudent conſideration of not giuing diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment to the king of Fraunce and our State: I ſay for theſe cauſes and ſome other like, &amp; to giue ſatisfaction to all parts, who vpon anie of the former grounds or colours haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued amiſſe of it, I thought it my bounden dutie (eſpecially my brethren moſt earneſtly importuning me) to reſume and finiſh the poore labours which I had begun and layd aſide.</p>
            <p>When the Cardinal Protectors letters were ſhewed vnto vs for inſtitution of the authoritie, we tooke our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, before God and man, to ſubiect our ſelues thereunto, his Grace not ſending with the Letter Conſtitutiue any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of his Holineſſe, or other Canonicall teſtimonie for proofe of ſuch his iuriſdiction in our countrey: and we reſted the more confident, and ſecure in this opinion, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect it appeared moſt manifeſt vnto vs, that the authoritie was procured by falſe ſuggeſtion, and by a man much diſliked
<pb facs="tcp:16974:5"/> of our Prince and ſtate, and who ſought to rule &amp; command our Clergie: and alſo for that it was propounded vnto vs by M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> with apparant falſities, and with orders directly tending to tyrannie, namely <hi>that we ſhould not diſcuſſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors authoritie, nor the inſtitution of our Superiours, nor make any ſecret meetings for aduiſing one the other,</hi> when as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our ſtate embarreth vs to meete publikely, <hi>nor write letters to any beyond the ſeas, without his priuitie.</hi> For theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and for that the authoritie it ſelfe was moſt ſtrange, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of in the Chriſtian world, meerely penall, without mixture of any benefite to our ſelues, Church or countrey, of moſt abſolute ſoueraigntie, without tye in the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to any forme of law, other then the arbitrarie pleaſure of the Archprieſt: and the receiuing of the ſayd authoritie, (the ſame being a ſuperiour prelature) expreſly, and vnder heauie penalties forbidden <note n="b" place="margin">Ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe exceptions and iuſtifications of our bearing off to admit the ſubordination: we neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe offered to obey Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> in the meane, though not to receiue him to our Superiour, till ſuch time as the Pope ſhould make forth his Breue, or otherwiſe confirme him in his place, and likewiſe proteſted vnder our hands, that no ſooner ſhould any ſuch Breue or confirmation appeare, but that it ſhould find vs readie moſt abſolutely to receiue the authoritie. But this was not deemed ſufficient, nor ought could ſatisfie, but our preſent ſubmiſſion. Which becauſe we deferred to make, and did not yeeld to acknowledge him for our Superiour vpon teſtimonie of the Cardinals letter, father <hi>Liſter</hi> diuulged his condemned Treatiſe againſt vs; his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour father <hi>Garnet,</hi> and M. <hi>Blackwel</hi> approued the ſame. They
<pb facs="tcp:16974:6"/> taught, <hi>that our company was to be ſhunned: that our faculties</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Fa. Liſters treatiſe, and in Fa. Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets letter of the 7. of March.</note> 
               <hi>were loſt: that our ſelues were excommunicated: that none vnder mortall ſinne could inuite vs to ſay Maſſe: and thoſe that did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate with vs in Sacraments, made themſelues alſo partakers of our wickedneſſe.</hi> Which inflaming matter of diſſention, and vntollerable reuiling againſt vs, laſted ſome moneths: and when at laſt the Popes Breue arriued, we were content not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſharpneſſe of the premiſſes, to forgiue all for peace ſake, and receiued the Subordination in as large maner as it was propoſed.</p>
            <p>Preſently vpon this atonement and remiſſion of the former defamations, Father <hi>Iones</hi> raiſed another paradox, farre more ſtrange and abſurd then that of Father <hi>Liſters,</hi> and our Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt ſoothed it to be true, vidz. that whoſoeuer did ſtiffely maintaine, that we had not incurred the crime of ſchiſme by the prorogation of our refuſall to receiue M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> for our lawfull Superiour, he himſelfe <hi>ipſo facto</hi> for ſuch his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance incurred the cenſures of holy Church. At this time alſo M <hi>Blackwell</hi> publiſhed a reſolution, which (he ſaid) <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from our mother citie, declaring the refuſers of the appointed authoritie were ſchiſmatikes, and commaunded that none ſhould abſolue vs in confeſsion, vnleſſe we did firſt acknowledge ſo much,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In his Letter to Maſter Clearke.</note> 
               <hi>and likewiſe menaced, that if we did perſeuere in the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he would deale with vs as a Prelate for appeaſing the ſame.</hi> Vpon which order, and threate of our Archprieſt, and as well for ſatisfaction of our ghoſtly children, as to make a finall end of the controuerſie, we offered to diſpute the queſtion with the Ieſuites, the authors of the Calumniation: but being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed this iuſt requeſt by our Archprieſt, we ſent (compelled thereunto) to the Vniuerſitie of Paris, with humble petition to that venerable companie of the Sorbons, that they would vouchſafe to deliuer their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; cenſure in the caſe. Who freeing vs from ſchiſme and all ſinne in the nature of the act,
<pb facs="tcp:16974:6"/> our Archprieſt made foorth eftſoones a decree, <hi>prohibiting</hi>

By which, and ſome other of our Archprieſt his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees following in the diſcourſe, the reader may iudge, both what an vnworthy and ſeruile bondage he and the Ieſuites, (whoſe counſell, or direction) he exactly followeth in all things) haue, and would more, of all likelyhood haue brought vpon vs ere this day, if we had not appealed and wrote to his Holines, and alſo whether there remayned any other refuge vnto vs then to appeale and try the accuſations before that Tribunall, vnto whoſe iudgement both they and we muſt ſtand.</p>
            <p>Further, we haue ſeuerall times ſued for peace at the hands of our aduerſaries, euen vpon vneuen conditions: namely, before the firſt Breue, before and after our appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and before our brethrens preparation to <hi>Rome:</hi> but they
<pb facs="tcp:16974:7"/> of the other ſide euermore reiected all our offers, nor would accept of any conditions, wherein our vtter diſcredit, and their victory (though in vnrights) ſhould not appeare to the world.

            </p>
            <p>We truſt by the litle which is ſaid, that both the neceſſitie, and iuſtneſſe of our defence appeareth: &amp; ſo much the more, by how much the wrong teſtimonie which our Archprieſt lately gaue on the ninth of May 1602. concerning the Popes declaration in the matter of our imputatiue ſchiſme, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and diſobedience, was iniurious vnto vs, in that his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe cleering vs of the three foreſaid crimes, M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> in a publike Letter vnder his hand and name, denieth the ſame, and maketh his Holineſſe and the two Cardinals, <hi>Burgeſio</hi> and <hi>Arragone</hi> to ſpeake much otherwiſe: yea his Reuerence in an other Letter bearing the ſame date, &amp; addreſſed to the Prieſts of our countrey, reneweth all his former decrees and prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, continuing the cenſures &amp; penalties before annexed vnto them. Whereby, if the like oppreſſions, exceeding the boundes of his iuriſdiction, and contrary to the law of God, nature, and man, (as is proued in the Diſcourſe) did or could bind, alas what infinite turmoile and harrowing of conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:16974:7"/> do follow, when ſo many Prieſts of the Realme were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and depriued of their faculties, from the firſt time,<note place="margin">In his decree of the 17. of Ianuar. 1599.</note> that they either <hi>diuulged any booke ſet out ſince the yeare of our Lord 1597, by which the fame of any clergie Catholike perſon of our nation may be hurt by name;</hi> (of which quality the Treatiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the factious, the Apollogie, the Appendix with ſome other, muſt needes be accompted by the ſelfe Letter and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Decree) <hi>or directly or indirectly maintained in word or</hi>

            <p>Father <hi>Parſons</hi> ſhewed his nature, when plotting the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, he made the taking away of faculties the branch of the Archprieſts iuriſdiction, and our Archprieſt in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, could not deuiſe a more pregnant meane, howe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the ſpirituall repoſe of thouſands (a thing which Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates ſhould moſt of all ſhunne, as being moſt oppoſitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the end of all Eccleſiaſtical lawes) then to annexe the loſſe of faculties to his Decrees in the maner he hath. Nor can I conceiue the reaſon why his Reuerence at this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualidateth and inforceth the penalties of his Decrees, ſith he hath often annexed vnto them the cenſure of Interdict, a power which is not expreſſed in his authoritie, and which if he do take, as he ſaith he doth, <hi>à iure communi,</hi> in that he is conſtituted Archprieſt, then were the ſixe Aſſiſtants very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduiſed,

Beſides, to diſpoſe of the ſame Prieſtes, and to remoue and change them from one reſidence to another, when Gods greater glorie and gaine of ſoules doth require the ſame. Alſo to heare their doubts and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies ariſing, and for the right of things to determine them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reaſon and equitie. Likewiſe to remoue or repreſſe ſchiſmes, diuiſions, and contentions: and for theſe cauſes to call and conuent any Prieſt before you, yea to ſummon many to repaire together in one place, when it ſhall be neceſſarie, and ſhall ſeeme in our Lord that it may be done without probable daunger, and to be chiefe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the aſſembled, and to propoſe vnto them either the things you ſhall iudge neceſſarie to be obſerued by them, the aſſiſtants being heard, of which we wil ſpeak anon, or the things you ſhall think need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be written hither, or to doctor <hi>Barret</hi> Preſident of the Colledge of <hi>Doway,</hi> to whom by commandement of his Holines, we haue giuen ſpeciall authoritie to aſſiſt you. And if any one in theſe matters ſhall ſhew himſelfe (which truly putting truſt in the vertue of all, we do not feare that it will fall out) diſobedient, vnquiet, or ſtubborn, it is lawful,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16974:13"/> after due admonitions &amp; reprehenſions firſt vſed in brotherly charity, to correct this party by Eccleſiaſtical penalties: that is to ſay, either by taking away of faculties, or ſuſpenſion, vntill he ſhall amend himſelfe; or if by this meane amendment follow not, then let notice be ſent either to Doctor <hi>Barret</hi> or to vs, that he who is of ſuch obſtinacie ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be called from thence, or there humbled with more grieuous cenſures.</p>
            <p>And to the end you may the eaſier and with the more conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation execute this charge of care commended vnto you, we aſſigne likewiſe ſix conſultors or coadiutors, who by participation of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, may ſomewhat leſſen you labour, namely <hi>Iohn Bauen</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Henſhaw,</hi> Doctors of Diuinitie, <hi>Nicholas Tirwit, Henry Shaw, George Birket,</hi> and <hi>Iames Standiſh,</hi> who was lately with vs in <hi>Rome,</hi> which by the relation of many we vnderſtand to be of the more auncient and beſt deſerts.

All which twelue nominated as well by you as by vs, ſhall be ſubordinate vnto you, that the meanes of vnion may the better be conſerued, to the maintenance and preſeruation whereof all things are directed. And when you haue choſen thoſe, whom you ſhall deeme in our Lord to be moſt fit for the office, you ſhall aduertiſe vs of their names and qualities, and let themſelues alſo ſo farre as it may be done without daunger, ſignifie by their letters how they ſtand affected to performe this which for the conſeruation of vnity is earneſtly deſired of them. Afterward we enioyne both them and you, to write euery ſixth moneth if it may be, common or priuate letters vnto vs, of the ſtate of matters with you, that of theſe we may relate to his Holineſſe ſuch as are meete to be knowne, or the things that ſhall be deemed profitable to your cauſe, to the end they may be knowne to his Holineſſe.</p>
            <p>And if any of theſe twelue which we haue appointed to giue counſell vnto you, for better managing of the affaire, ſhall be abſent, or dead, or taken, or impriſoned, or departed out of England, or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by infirmity, ſickneſſe, or any other iuſt impediment, whereby he cannot fulfill his office, or ſhall not well demaine himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: we giue you power to ſubſtitute another in his place, ſo that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16974:14"/> afterward you aduertiſe vs thereof by your Letters. But if the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt him elfe dye, or leaue England, or ſhall fall into the hands of his enemies, ſo that he cannot conueniently exerciſe his function: then let the auncienteſt of the conſultors who at that time ſhall reſide in London or neareſt to London, execute the office of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, vntill we vnderſtanding thereof, aſſigne another.</p>
            <p>Finally, you ought chiefly to know that which before we haue touched; his Holineſſe principall intention and mine in theſe affaires to tend to this end, that Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline ſo much as due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of times and perſons will there ſuffer be maintained, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the reſt peace and vnion of minds and concord betweene bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Prieſts, particularly alſo with the Fathers of the ſociety of Ieſus, that haue laboured together with you in one vineyard.</p>
            <p>The which thing his Holineſſe vouchſafed of late with his owne mouth in my preſence earneſtly and inſtantly to giue in commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to certaine Prieſts departing from hence into England, neither without iuſt cauſe. For theſe Fathers not onely here and otherwhere, do with courage and diligently trauell for ſupporting the Engliſh cauſe, by erecting Seminaries, by inſtructing youth, by cheriſhing the needy, and by very many other meanes, but alſo in England too, they proſecute the ſame deeds of charity, and this euen to the ſheding of bloud, as the euent and deeds haue demonſtrated. And whereas they<note place="margin">VVould this were true.</note> haue no kind of iuriſdiction or authority, nor pretend to haue, ouer the ſecular Prieſts, neither any way to diſquiet them; certes it ſeemeth to be a manifeſt ſubtilty of the enemy and deceipt of the diuell, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotted for the ouerthrow of the whole Engliſh cauſe, that any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike ſhould practiſe or ſtirre vp emulation againſt them, when contrariwiſe all affection and reuerence is rather to be ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, whereby they may with the greater alacritie embrace the reſidue of the Prieſts (as hitherto) with good offices, benefits, and altogether with fatherly charity, and ſo with vnited minds and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, this moſt holy worke be ſet forward.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if there ſhall be any who goeth about to weaken this concord, your duty ſhall be to note him according to the precept of the Apoſtle and intention of the Sea Apoſtolicke, that either he may be reformed by admonition, or by diſcipline corrected. The reſidue if there ſhall be any remaining, ſhall either be ſpecified in the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions adioyning to theſe, or written hereafter when we ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by your letters what further things you there want.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:16974:14"/>
            <p>Wherefore to conclude, I do not know with what words better to ſpeake vnto you, then with thoſe which the Apoſtle ſo often vſed to his in the like cauſe, and perchance not in vnlike occaſion nor time. <hi>Be of one mind, haue peace.</hi> And yet more inſtantly. <hi>If there be any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in Chriſt, if any ſolace of charity, if any ſociety of ſpirite, if any bowels of commiſeration fulfill my ioy, that you be of one meaning, hauing the ſame charity, of one mind, agreeing in one; nothing by contention, neither by vaine-glory, but in humility, each counting other better then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. That euery one not conſidering the things that are their owne, but thoſe that be other mens.</hi>
            </p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Erie reuerend and beloued in Chriſt as our brother: vndoubtedly we tooke ſingular great contentment in the frequent letters, which both your charity, your conſultors the aſſiſting Prieſts, and many other graue men ſent vnto me of late, concerning the iuſt glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and common approbation of the ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which his Holineſſe vpon iuſt and godly cauſes appointed to be inſtituted by vs in this Engliſh Cleargy. This truly was alwayes to be expected, as well from the ſingular opinion of your vertue, as alſo from the profeſſion of your excellent life; that ye, who vnder-go ſo much danger, and take ſo great paines in againe-reſtoring due obedience to the Vicar of Chriſt and Sea Apoſtolike, your ſelues refuſe not to obey the ordinances of the ſame holy Sea; but rather with chearfull mind (as you haue done) you would imbrace with open armes (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is) the appointments of your higheſt Paſtor, decreed for your profit, peace, and to make you ſtrong. And ſo vpon this yours and all good Prieſts, their alike ready and ioyfull obedience, and which they teſtified by letters; both his Holineſſe and my ſelfe, as the duty of my office required, and for the loue beſide which I feele to be ſingular to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, tooke certes no meane ioy and edification, which I could haue wiſhed to haue bene perpetuall or of long continuance. But vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon later intelligence it began to be ſomwhat diſturbed, when newes came that ſome (as it is wont to happen) enterpriſed to repugne and to raiſe vp contentions, alſo to make conuenticles to the end to call
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16974:16"/> the commandements of ſuperiours into queſtion. Finally in proceſſe it was ſignified to his Holineſſe by Miniſters abiding as it ſeemeth in the North parts, that two Prieſts were ſent out of England by the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous, which contradict this ſubordination of the Church of England inſtituted by commaundement of his Holineſſe. Of which thing his Holineſſe being aduertiſed, he tooke it (as it was meete) very grieuouſly, and would be more fully informed of the perturbers. And ſith your charity hath not as yet written any certaintie vnto vs of this matter, nor of the manners &amp; actions of thoſe men (which doubtleſſe is attributed to your modeſty and pietie, as one who is not eaſily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to accuſe his brethren) yet now his Holineſſe commanding the ſame, that due information be giuen of all, you muſt needs labour that the truth of things be layd open by you in taking and traſporting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs (ſo farre forth as conueniently and without daunger it may be done) the iudgement of thoſe good men that accord with you, and in noting the names of the contenders apart, and in ſignifying the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which they pretend of their reluctation. The which thing that you may by the authority of our ordination performe with the more eaſe and ſpeed, this we enioyne you and the reſt of the Prieſtes, that it be forthwith and diligently accompliſhed. And we haue commaunded that many copics of theſe letters be ſent vnto you, to the end they may be ſhewed to many for quicker diſpatch of the affaire: beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching our Lord to fill you with the great abundance of his bleſſings, and make you worthy of peace and true charity, which is the bond of all perfection.

Graunts extend not their force beyond the intention and meaning of the graunter, his intention and meaning being the ſelfe forme, and the onely true rule and limites of what he graunteth. If therefore his Holineſſe had no further intention to graunt or commaund the inſtitution of the new authoritie, but as the information was true (as of likelihood he had not) and if not, then it followeth the cauſes and information being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, that the graunt was of no effect in regard it had not his Holines intention, will, or meaning, to giue it life, vigour or validitie. And this we take to be one of the principall grounds, why the receiued Gloſſe vſeth theſe words: <note n="n" place="margin">In Ca. ſua no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis de oſſi. vicar.</note>

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:16974:17"/> As if one ſhould ſay, what is obtained by meanes of wrong information, lacketh the Popes conſent, becauſe he graunteth it not, but vpon credence that the information was true, which being not true, he had no intention to grant it: and hauing no intention to grant it, it followeth that no iuriſdiction was conferred, becauſe the axiome hath <note n="o" place="margin">Ca. fin. de prebend.</note>

               <p>And if our aduerſaries will needes here contend, that the Popes Graunt, and the Cardinals Letter for the new ſubordination was mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of iuſtice, and not of grace and fauour onely, (as how they can ſay it, we do not know) and therefore the authorities afore going make nothing for vs, or againſt them. We anſwer, that admit the ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be matter of meere iuſtice, neuertheleſſe the reaſon immediatly precedent doth hold, and the ſtronger: becauſe in reſcripts and grants of iuſtice, this condition <hi>Si praeces veritate nitantur</hi> if the cauſes allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the petition be true, is alwayes to be vnderſtood, euen by the expreſſe direction and commaund of the <note n="p" place="margin">Ca. ex parte 1. de reſcript.</note> law it ſelfe. And we adde further, that the ſubordination being procured by ſurreption, our bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring off to admit the ſame, could neither be vnlawfull, or iuſtly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue to any one.

               <p>Now the reaſons why we did fully perſwade our ſelues, that the cauſes alleaged and ſet downe in the Conſtitutiue Letter were not true: and conſequently that the authoritie did not bind vs, as obtained by vntrue ſuggeſtion, were aſwell ſeuerall truths concealed, as falſities
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16974:18"/> related, and to name ſome of either ſort.</p>
               <p>One of the truths concealed, was our deſigne at that time and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt purpoſe to make ſute by Supplication to his Holineſſe for crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Biſhoppes in our Church. To which we were not onely caried by a longing deſire we had to reduce (as much as in vs lay) the broken ſtate of our Church to an vniformitie of Eccleſiaſticall Hierachie, and cuſtomarie regiment with all Chriſtendome, but alſo by a moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble feeling of thoſe manifeſt damages we dayly ſuſtaine, and which day by day more increaſe vpon vs, for lacke of ſuch ſprituall comforts as accompanie that diuine and ſacred kind of gouernment: to wit, the miniſtring of the Sacrament of Confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the conſecrating of holy Oyles, with many moe. The firſt whereof a comfort ſo many waies ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for increaſe of ſtrength and true courage in theſe our no weak combats, as not any thing (the infinite number of our lay Catholickes conſidered, who neuer receiued the benefite of this Sacrament) can lightly appeare to be of greater or equall neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>It is now more then 40. yeares paſt ſince we had a Catholike Biſhop at libertie in place to exerciſe his function: and for theſe latter twenty yeares and ſomewhat more, our Countrey hath not had a Catholicke Engliſh Biſhop either in priſon or out of priſon: albeit, <hi>Ireland</hi> an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſubiect to her Maieſtie, and trauelling in like diuerſitie of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as England doth, was neuer in all this while deſtitute of one, two, or more, made ſucceſſiuely by the fauour and appointment of the ſea Apoſtolicke. § Vndoubtedly if our brethren and the Catholikes of our Realme, would ſeriouſly ponder on the ſeuerall graces, which iſſue from this Sacrament as from their natiue fountaine, and of other no common benefites which attend vpon that forme of gouernement, as the ſhadow doth vpon the bodie: they would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Dioniſyus Eccl.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16974:18"/> the receiuer, as is betwixt the ſtate and ſtrength of a man and a child? For as we do not receiue ſo great ſtrength and quantitie of bodie in our birth, as we do after by the benefite of food and ſuſtenance: ſo (the Sacrament of Baptiſme &amp; Sacrament of Confirmation working alike in ſpirituall matters, as do our birth and nouriſhment in naturall) the grace and ſpirituall fortitude we receiue in Baptiſme, regiſtring vs in the family of Chriſt, is not of that degree, actiuitie, and operation, as is the grace which giuen vs in the Sacrament of Confirmation, enrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs the profeſſed ſouldiours of our heauenly Captaine Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

Yea further at the very ſame time when he addreſſed his letter to the Cardinall, he could not be but weeting to the reuiuall of the old, and increaſe of the new diſſentions at the ſame place, and among the ſayd perſons, and which alſo were of no ſmall moment, and of much diſedification.

                  <p>A Superior proceeding vniuſtly (as he doth when he commandeth more then the place and authoritie he holdeth giueth him leaue) may without all imputation of blame (the peril of ſcandall euer excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) be as lawfully reſiſted as an <note n="a" place="margin">Nauar. in ca contingat cauſa 5. nullitatis n 8</note> aduerſarie, as a <note n="b" place="margin">D.

So that to diſobey a Superior, enlarging his precepts beyond the vtmoſt bounds of his authoritie, is ſo farre from the nature of criminall diſobedience, as it cannot be ſaid to be the leaſt ſinne: yea the caſe may be ſuch, as it were ſinne and perhaps great ſinne to obey.

                  <p>THeſe grounds being laid, we proceed and affirme that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Letter, as it is plaine to the Reader, maketh no mention at al of any Mandate or Commiſſion which his Holines ſhould giue, other then that he ſhould imploy his indeuour to make peace in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to the example of the peace and quietnes eſtabliſhed in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Colledge at Rome. And how this commaundement did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate authoritie to the Cardinall to inſtitute an Archprieſt ouer vs, with like iuriſdiction and ſoueraigntie as is expreſſed in the <hi>Letter Conſtitutiue,</hi> appeared a more ſtrange point vnto vs, then we could vnderſtand, or find out any ground, or ſhew of reaſon, how the ſaid commaundement of his Holineſſe could any way be in ſuch ſort poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly extended, and retaine force to bind. For what neceſſary connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is there betweene making of peace in our Country, and inſtituting
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16974:25"/> of an Archprieſt ouer one part of thoſe that were at variance, with iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction to ſpoile them of their faculties, to remoue them from their places of reſidence, to depriue them of the vſe of their Prieſtly functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to afflict and vnable them to do good in our Church, and in no degree to ſubordinate the other more principall part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to the leaſt iot of the ſame iuriſdiction? We ſay, what neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſtraight coniunction is there between the two precedents, that Commiſſion being graunted to labour and effectuate the one, viz. peace in our Countrey, authoritie muſt thereby be thought to be graunted to erect and appoint the other, viz. an Archpriſt? Muſt the aſſigning of an Archprieſt with ſuch iuriſdiction be holden alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſicall or dependant an acceſſorie to the taking vp of diſſention, and of making peace, as not ordaining the one, the other could not be effected? None will ſay it that ſhall compare them together, and none can ſay it, that haue wel looked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſequell: conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſtrife, debate, variance, broiles, ſcandall, parts-taking, enmitie, ſlaunders, calumniati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wrongs, iniuries, being now moſt rife in our Church, and neuer heard of before. Neither any maruell at all, whiles one who was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne vnto vs to haue any ſuch authoritie, nor many yeares euer holden but for our backe friend, would inſtitute in our Church a new forme of gouernement, the like neuer heard of in the world, meerely penall, wholly conſiſting in puniſhing, and in puniſhing contrarie to the forme of law, that is, without citing, without triall, without proofe of the accuſation. And to bring this intollerable burden vpon vs, without making ſo much as any one of our bodie priuie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and alſo to giue vs none other ſatisfaction of this his Graces ſtraunge proceeding in our Church, but onely the warrant of his owne Letter, and the ſame not addreſſed to vs neither, but to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour onely, whom himſelfe without all our conſents or weeting pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the office, by the ſole information of him, whoſe buſie head and actions haue bene the cauſe and increaſe of much trouble and perſecution in our Church and Realme. And who being a member of another bodie: and profeſſing alſo a mortified ſtate, and to haue relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the world, ſeeketh neuertheleſſe to be our great maiſter, and to rule all: and would to God but to rule, and not to domineere or ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize rather.</p>
                  <p>Let any practiſed Gouernour Eccleſiaſticall or temporall, or any one of common vnderſtanding in the world, tell vs whether this plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, this new and ſtrange kind of gouernement, and as ſtraunge a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16974:25"/> maner of proceeding in it, were a meane to make peace, or not rather the high way to breake peace, to kindle debates, to multiply diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and as it were to ſtrike vp an alatum of troubles in our poore affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Church, too manifoldly (if it pleafed God to the contrarie) alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die toſſed?</p>
                  <p>The new authoritie therefore being in it ſelfe no greater a helpe to the ſetting forward of peace, and in the ſequell ſo preiudicious; the firſt, ſecond, third, and fifth Propoſitions, ſhew that his Holineſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding the Cardinall to beſtow his paines for the eſtabliſhing of peace and concord, to the patterne of the peace wrought in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Colledge at Rome, did not therin for ought appeareth, or may be gathered out of the Conſtitutiue Lettet, giue commiſſion to his Grace to enact the foreſaid iuriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the ſecond, third, and fifth Propoſitions declare, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacting of the like authoritie, not being ſo nigh linked and vnited an acceſſorie to the principal in charge, as the one might not be wel effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted without the inſtitution of the other, declare we ſay, that we were not bound by any law of holy Church or duty of obedience, to ſubiect our ſelues to ſuch his Graces ordinance: becauſe his Grace ſeemed eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the tenour of the ſelfe Conſtitutiue Letter, to haue exceeded the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of his Holineſſe Commiſſion vnto him, in that receiuing but a commaundement to make peace, he made an Archprieſt, and indued him with largeſt puniſhing iuriſdiction and ſoueraigntie ouer vs. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which were behooueable, or not ſo behooueable to the making of peace, as that peace could not be made without theſe, as is already ſhewed. And therefore his Graces decree, touching the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination could not, at leaſt in the iudgement of our owne thoughts bind vs, the ſame appearing vnto vs to be an exceſſer or too great an enlargement of the delegation committed. Plaine by the authorities and proues laid downe in the ſaid Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>But if our aduerſaries ſhall here ſay, that the Conſtitutiue Letter maketh mention how his Grace in ordaining the new authoritie, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed therein the will of his Holineſſe: we may anſwere, that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as we did, and vpon moſt pregnant grounds, that father <hi>Parſons</hi> was the inditer of the letter, we had little reaſon knowing him as we do, to credit euery word therin, eſpecially the matter being ſo greatly preiudiciall to our ſelues, Church, and Realme, and ſo fit a riſe or ſtep beſides, to his further deſignes.</p>
                  <p>Another reaſon alſo, and which more induced vs not to beleeue
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16974:26"/> euery word in the Cardinals Letter, was the report it made of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly charitie which the Ieſuits exhibited towards all Prieſtes in our countrey, and that they moleſted no one. An affirmance ſo farre from truth, as to doubt whether it be true or no, were to doubt whether yee be cold or fire hote, or whether there be a Sunne in the element. For who can deny, vnleſſe he be reſolued to deny any thing how apparant or demonſtrable ſoeuer, but that all the Cleargy and ſociall diſſention in our Realme proceeded from ſome of the fathers of the Society? The diſſention at <hi>Wiſhich</hi> from fa. <hi>Weſton</hi> aſſuming ſuperioritie, the diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now on foot, from fa. <hi>Liſter</hi> the author, from fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> the approuer: from fa. <hi>Iones</hi> the increaſer, from fa. <hi>Holtby</hi> the maintainer, and from ſome other of the Society, the abettours of our moſt grieuous wrongs and infamie.</p>
                  <p>Thus no doubt we might anſwer, and neither idlely nor vntruly, yet we will not thus anſwer, but referre our ſelues to the ſixth Propoſition, which yeeldeth another kind of reioynder, and bringeth more light and helpe to our cauſe and innocencie.</p>
                  <p>For the ſaid Propoſition teacheth, that the formall obiect of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is the knowne precept of a Superiour, not the ſole will, vnleſſe it be an imperatiue or commanding will, and ſo notified as the ſubiect vnderſtand it to be a commaund.</p>
                  <p>So that admitting we had bene bound to heleeue euery word in the Cardinals Letter, as how little we were bound it will appeare anon, and more in the next reaſon: yet the Cardinall vſing but theſe words (<hi>Nos S<hi rend="sup">tis</hi> ſuae pijſſimam prouidentiſſimam<expan>

                  <p>Beſide, the reaſons were neither few nor vulgar, but many and very materiall, which droue vs to thinke, that if his Holineſſe had poſſeſſed ſuch a determination, as at vnawares without any one of our aſſents or priuitie, to appoint vs a ſuperiour, and with ſo large ſoueraigntie ouer vs, yet that he would neuer haue vſed ſo little fauour towards vs, who liue in the midſt of ſo many miſeries, and dayly ſpend our liues for the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:16974:26"/> truth and primacie of that Chaire, as to enact the authoritie in ſo powerable a manner, that euen at the firſt appearing thereof, and by the bare Letter of one Cardinall only, it ſhould be the crime either of notorious diſobedience or ſchiſme (an impoſſibilitie) euen not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our ſelues, and ſurrender our full and abſolute obedience thereunto, without either making queſtion how it c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That his Holineſſe vſed theſe ſpeeches, there be two Prieſts or moe in England that will depoſe it: and father <hi>Parſons</hi> himſelfe hauing more then once reported ſo much, cannot without doing wrong to his religious profeſſion, denie or vnſay the ſame, So that the queſtion reſted, whether of theſe two we ſhould ſooner and were more bound<note place="margin">☜</note> to beleeue, the Popes owne word or the Cardinals Letter. Either the Popes word related vnto vs by ſeuerall of our brethren of good report, and the immediate hearers thereof, or the Cardinals Letter penned as we no whit doubted, by our boldeſt aduerſarie contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning apparant vntruthes, as before is ſhewed, and will hereafter more appeare.</p>
                  <p>And now, the matter of our choiſe to whom we ſhould giue more credite, being of this quality: whether ſooner to beleeue the Popes owne word, or the Cardinals Letter, was it poſſible that father <hi>Liſter</hi> or any other of leſſe holy profeſſion and of meaner parts, could em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden their pens and tongues to by-name vs ſo prodigally as he and ſome of his complicers haue done? Or could it be thought cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, that our ſuperiour, who by his place and order of charity, is the

Let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who can, aunſwere. We will returne and proceede in our proues.</p>
                  <p>Senior <hi>Acriſio</hi> of the Popes Fiſcals, and who had commiſſion to examine maiſter <hi>Biſhop</hi> and maiſter <hi>Charnocke</hi> in their impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Rome, hath giuen very good teſtimony, &amp; with like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as not lightly any euidence may deſerue more beliefe. For this officer hauing by himſelfe and father <hi>Parſons</hi> taken the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two priſoners, and demanded of like as many queſtions of them, as were thought neceſſary, he told them that now he was to make relation of all things to his Holineſſe, and therefore counſelled them to commend the cauſe to God by prayer, adding that it were not amiſſe alſo, if they would enioyne to themſelues three dayes faſt that weeke, for better proſpering of the affaire. A ſpirituall taske which the priſoners gladly vndertooke, and performed in the time preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>The next weeke Senior <hi>Acriſio</hi> came to the priſoners, and among other matters very confidently affirmed to them both apart, that the new ſuperiority was not inſtituted by his Holineſſe command, as his Holineſſe himſelfe (with whom the day before he had conference a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſame point) told him, and yeelded for reaſon, that he durſt not enact a forme of gouernement in our countrey (ô the ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that was giuen againſt vs) for that he would not aduenture to haue his authority contemned of the Prieſts in England.</p>

For vndoubtedly if there had not layd a pad in the ſtraw, or ſome ſecret hid in the decke of the ſtratageme, which Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> would not haue his Holineſſe and others to ſee: what need was there for him to procure (doubtleſſe by no charitable or true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation) the impriſoning of his countrey-men, of Prieſts, of labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in Gods vineyard, of thoſe who for zeale of religion, had made themſelues incapable of fauour in their owne countrey, and one of them relinquiſhed a rich inheritance; to procure the impriſoning of thoſe who for many yeares ſpace, had continually ventured their liues, and with good profit, for reducing of ſoules to the obedience of the Sea Apoſtolike: to procure the impriſoning of thoſe, who with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſiueneſſe of duty came a long and a chargeable iourney to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe foote, out of loue and conſcience to vnfold all things to his wiſedome, and for truer vnderſtanding of his Holineſſe pleaſure? What neede was there not onely to impriſon them before they were heard, or could come to the preſence of his Holineſſe, but to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them with Isberze by night, with torches moſt infamouſly, and himſelf (a religious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to be the leader &amp; chieftaine? What need was there to impriſon them apart, to rifle them of all the inſtructions, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and notes they brought, to keepe them cloſe without licence ſo
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16974:28"/> ſo much as to heare Maſſe, euen vpon ſome of the chiefeſt feaſts in Gods Church? What need was there for himſelfe to be their Iailour,<note place="margin">New yeares day and Twelfe day.</note> and keeper of the keyes of both their chambers? What need was there to deny them to haue their learned counſel or Aduocates which they ſeuerally and earneſtly requeſted, and which ſeemed ſo iuſt a petition as father <hi>Holby</hi> in his diſcourſe of the laſt of Iune 1601. auoweth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ferious proteſtation, that they had it graunted vnto them, and bringeth it in, to imply their greater guiltineſſe, for that hauing their learned counſell and pleaders allowed, were neuertheleſſe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and found worthy of the puniſhment layd vpon them, which was to be baniſhed, and confined in the baniſhment, without any contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution or reliefe at all towards their maintenance? What neede was there, their arreſt and impriſonment being ſo publickly knowne as it was, and the whole courſe and manner thereof being ſo ſtraunge, as it could not but giue token to euery one of ſome notable and hainous crime in them, to try them after in ſecret in the Colledge, and to ſuffer neither ſcholler of the houſe, nor externe, nor any at all, to be preſent at their triall, beſide the two Cardinals their Iudges, Senior <hi>Acriſio</hi> the Fiſcall, father <hi>Tichborne</hi> the Notary, Doctor <hi>Haddocke,</hi> &amp; maſter <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Array</hi> aduocates for the Archprieſt, himſelfe, and the two priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to the ende no doubt, that none might witneſſe, lament, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, for what ſinfull treſpaſſe (ſo to call their Chriſtian intents) they were ſo long and ſo ſtraightly impriſoned, and condemned to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance of ſo greatly infamous and extreame puniſhment? What neede was there neuer to releaſe them of their durance, no not after their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all before the two Cardinals, vntil ſuch times as his Holineſſe had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the authority by his Breue? What need was there that in the verie graunt of the priſoners liberty, they muſt be enioyned vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uieſt penalties to depart the city within twelue dayes, and that the dayes of the one muſt be expired too, ere the other might be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, or ſet foote out of the Colledge? What need was there that the priſoners being to be exiled and confined, might not yet (as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deſired) be confined together in one place or prouince? In fine, what need was there that our two brethren might not at leaſt going both one way for many hundreth of miles to the places aſſigned of their confinement, could neuertheleſſe vpon their inſtant deſire be ſuffered to take comfort one of the others company, being both Prieſts, in ſo weariſome, dangerous, and deſolate a iourney?</p>
                  <p>Vndoubtedly theſe &amp; other like vſages inſinuated ſomething: they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:16974:28"/> had their meaning: fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> is wiſe, and therfore how little ſoeuer his complexion inclineth him to pittie, yet he would not ſhew the like extremities for manifeſting his inclination and potencie onely. He deuiſed the platforme of the gouernement: our brethren diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it. Enough: Or if we ſhould adde more, what muſt we ſay? The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie being a bird of fath. <hi>Garnet</hi> and father <hi>Parſons</hi> own hatching, and the man whom they promoted thereunto of their owne chuſing: alſo the forme of the ſubordination creating themſelues in truth and vnderhand, the appointers of the Archprieſt, the deſigners of the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, the makers of our lawes, the diſpenſers, the diſpoſers, the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, the commaunders, and our great maſters in all things. Their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes were too great not to haue the ſubordination to go forward, howſoeuer father <hi>Parſons</hi> his ſoule lay at pawne in the <hi>Interim,</hi> as wel for his vſage towards our two brethren, as alſo for abuſing therein of the Sea Apoſtolicke.</p>
                  <p>Neither among ſo many ſtrange wonders, could we maruell at any thing more, then what the cauſe or drift might be, why father <hi>Parſons</hi> comming on a time from his Holineſſe, told one of the priſoners<note place="margin">M. Charuock</note> that he had neuer ſo much ado, as to perſwade his Holines, that he and his fellow Agent were Catholicke Prieſtes and not heretickes; a thing as father <hi>Parſons</hi> auowed, which his Holineſſe would not beleeue of a long while. O good God, to what times are we reſerued to liue in, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that ſo vniuſt an information ſhould be giuen to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Paſtour againſt vertuous Prieſts, or that an auncient religious man, ſhould in ſuch ſort gloſe and counterfeit? For it cannot be poſſible, if his Holineſſe ſtood ſo conceited, but that very impious vntruths and with greateſt colour of truth were inculcated to his Holineſſe, ere his practiſed and aged iudgement could entertaine and ground ſo bad an opinion of Engliſh Prieſtes, as they comming ſo farre off vnto him, ſhould be of any other religion then Catholicke.</p>
                  <p>Two Prieſts to come out of England to Rome, and purpoſely to his Holineſſe Chaire, and in a meſſage and ſupplication from Prieſtes: whereof a good many were then, are now, and had bene a long while in durance for the Catholicke cauſe, and in an affaire meerely belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Romane Religion, with a preſt readines alſo to follow and obey his Holineſſe order in the ſame, as vnder their booke-othes they aſſured, are (we trow) no tokens of hereſie, but ableſt demonſtration of conuincing the contrarie.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould then be the cauſe that his Holines was poſſeſſed with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16974:29"/> ſo hard an opinion againſt them, and conſequently againſt vs all, from whom, and in whoſe names they came? Was it the matter they came about? Impoſsible, if right information had bene giuen: becauſe they came only to vnderſtand the truth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the new authoritie, and to open to his Holineſſe wiſedom, our difficulties about the ſame: and to acquaint him with the ſpiritual wants of our country, with humbleſt petition for ſupply. Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> (who had moſt cauſe to ſtretch the action to the hardeſt ſenſe againſt vs, in that it might beare ſome ſembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of an oppoſition againſt his ordinance) &amp; Cardinall <hi>Burgheſio</hi> openly acknowledged at the time when our two brethren appeared before them, ſitting in iudgement vpon their cauſe, that they could not find fault with the intention and matter they came for. And if the intention &amp; matter were lawfull or not iuſtly to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as both their Graces affirmed, let our aduerſaries tell what might the treſpaſſe be, why his Holineſſe mind was ſo greatly auerted, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his holy zeale incenſed?</p>
                  <p>The meſſengers were reported, the one to be a Maultſter and a Horſe-courſer, the other for an incontinent perſon. O tongue libertie whither runneſt thou? O father <hi>Parſons</hi> how credulous are you in bad matters? Let but this latter be proued, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding you ſaid (who perchance counteth ſuch a ſaying no bad pollicie) that a Prieſt ſware it, and two other Prieſtes tooke their othes that they heard him ſweare it, and we do all here yeeld our ſelues without further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction to be traytours to God and his Church, and craue the fagot.</p>
                  <p>There was a night-cappe with a border of blacke ſilke two fingers deepe, a dozen of ſilke points, fine ſockes, a ſword, and a dagger found in their chambers, and matter of much good ſport made therat: father <hi>Parſons</hi> the chiefeſt doer, hauing now forgotten how himſelfe went attired when he liued in England, and how ſome of his brethren here now go more coſtly then any Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>The meſſengers were accuſed, that they came to <hi>Rome</hi> to renue the ſtirs in the Colledge. The apprehenſion of M. <hi>Dudley,</hi> M. <hi>Barrowes,</hi> M. <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To make the bead-rowle long inough, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected that M. Doctour <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> had a penſion of fiftie pound a yeere
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16974:29"/> of her Maieſtie: that we dealt with the Counſell and tooke direction from them. The fall of M. <hi>Ithell,</hi> and the Apoſtacie of Frier <hi>Sacheuerill,</hi> were laid warmely in their diſh, with a long rable of ſurmiſes, what would become of ſome others if they hold on? Were not theſe fine exceptions (we appleale to the whole world) or accuſations rather? Who would euer think they could haue bin ſpoken without a vizard, or obiected by any who before had not ſhaken hands with all ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe? Alas alas, whither do vnruly humours driue ſuch, as ſerue them? For could there be groſſer tales deuiſed, if one would haue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for the whetſtone? or more infamous ſlaunders coined, if there had beene a diſpenſation graunted to forge at pleaſure? That theſe things were laid in the diſh of our two brethren, &amp; againſt vs their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, it cannot with any truth be denied, or but with the abandoning of a great deale of modeſtie be ſtood againſt. For ſundry Letters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the greateſt part of the premiſes, and which father <hi>Parſons</hi> had the peruſing of, and was the inditor or prompter of all, or moſt of the contents, and which alſo himſelfe ſent open into England, to and for our Archprieſt and others to reade, are yet extant, and both the prieſts liuing againſt whom the ſaid counterfeit crimes were obiected, and who are ready to witneſſe, or if need ſo require, to depoſe ſo much as before is rehearſed.</p>
                  <p>But what would we inferre out of all theſe? Verily not that father <hi>Parſons</hi> did accuſe them and vs to his Holines in al the foreſaid crimes, for then vndoubtedly his maners had bene ſo far diſcrepant from the etymologie of his religious name, as blacke is from white, or hell from heauen. Neuertheleſſe we cannot but aſſure our ſelues that he or ſome other (and none but himſelfe hath the office of informerſhip in the Engliſh affaires) plaid a monſtrous bad part in inciting his Holineſſe by vntrue and vngodly ſuggeſtion to conceiue ſo infinite hardly of our two brethren, as not to be brought but vpon long perſwaſion to thinke them to be Catholicke Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>Now although the reaſons, teſtimonies, and probabilities already alleaged may ſufficiently declare, what grounds we had to beleeue that his Holineſſe did neither commaund the inſtitution of the new authoritie, nor was priuie to the particulars: yet becauſe we deſire to abound in the purgation of our good names (being all that we haue to leeſe, and <hi>better then great riches</hi>) we will adde a few more for fuller<note place="margin">Prouerb. 22.</note> proofe and teſtimonie of the iſſue.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemed then a matter moſt improbable vnto vs, that his Holineſſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:16974:30"/> carrying a ſingular praiſe for his wiſedome and clemencie in gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, would euer appoint ſo barren an authoritie in our poore diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Church, as this appeared to be, conſiſting wholly in a libertie and freedome to puniſh without the admixture of the leaſt comfort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding to any thereby. Yea it appeared incredible in our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that his Holineſſe after ſo many tokens of fauour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards our miſeries, would ordaine the like ſtrange and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall gouernement, and not ſo much as to giue vs notice thereof from himſelfe by Breue or miſſiue letter: knowing that without ſuch imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate notice or other Canonicall certitude, we could neither in diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wiſedome, nor conſcience, admit ſo meere a burthen void of all maner of commoditie in our Church.</p>
                  <p>When his Holineſſe made Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> of bleſſed memory, our Superiour, he declared it by a Breue, notwithſtanding the ſtate and rich deſerts of the man, our founder in learning and common parent.<note place="margin">Note the precedent.</note> Which preſident and foregoing example, did in a ſort commaund vs to beleeue, that if the new ſubordination (farre more ſtraunge and in ſome points more ample too, then the authoritie of the good Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall) had bene the binding ordinance of his Holineſſe, his paſtorall wiſedome would in like manner haue vouchſafed (ſpecially conferring ſo large iuriſdiction vpon a priuate man, not in dignitie before, nor of any marke or reckening in compariſon of the true vertuous, a like wiſe, and moſt learned <hi>Allen</hi>) to publiſh and atteſtate ſuch his fact to our Church by a Breue or ſome other kind of Apoſtolicall writ. And we were alike thorow ſetled in this opinion, as we reckned the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a plaine derogation to his Holineſſe wiſedome, clemencie, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>Another probabilitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter</hi> as M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> read it vnto vs; directed (except our memories do much deceiue vs) that the reſt of the Aſſiſtants who were left to the Arch-prieſt to chuſe, ſhould be ſelected out of the number of the auncienteſt Prieſts, that had their places of reſidence in or neareſt about London, to the end (as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was adioyned) that he might vpon euery occurrance, haue ſome readie at hand to conſult withall. The breaking of which preſcript, forme and direction, did ſecure vs that the <hi>Letter Constitutiue</hi> was not the ordinance or commaundement of his Holineſſe. For if it had bene either, as there wanted not reaſon to moue vs, ſo did we throughly preſume, that neither M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> nor the Ieſuits (in truth the chiefe Electors) receiuing expreſſe direction to chuſe the reſt of the aſſiſtants
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16974:30"/> among the elder ſort of Prieſtes, reſiding in or neareſt about Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, would euer haue bene ſo venturous, as contrarie to the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme of the Commiſſion, not only to chuſe two, three, or foure of the Aſſiſtants, but the whole number of them in places furtheſt remote from the place aſſigned. And that ſuch a direction was expreſſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Cardinals Letter, as it was ſhewed vnto vs by M. <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> and my ſelfe (who were firſt of al ſent for before him to acknowledge the authority) are ready to witnes, and beſide the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of both our memories, the preſumptions enſuing do not a little ſeeme to confirme the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Anon after that M. <hi>Blackwel</hi> had choſen the ful number of the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, a Gentleman very inward with him in theſe affaires, brought their names vnto me in writing, which when I had read and ſaw that ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were choſen, dwelt in the North, another in <hi>Wales,</hi> another in the Weſt Country, and others in place farre diſtant, and no one, in or neare to London, the place aſſigned: I demaunded why M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> had not choſen his Aſſiſtants according to the direction of the Cardinals Letter out of the number of the auncienteſt Prieſts in and about London. The Gentleman not denying but that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals Letter ſo preſcribed, gaue this anſwere: that if M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> had choſen the Aſſiſtants according to the direction of the Cardinals Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in and neare about London, this inconuenience had followed, that he could not haue had, or not ſo conueniently by much, ſo ready aduertiſements from thoſe parts and quarters of the Realme, where he hath now choſen the Aſſiſtant, as by this meane (his Aſſiſtants there reſiding) he ſhall haue.</p>

For which reſpect, and alſo becauſe the reaſon alleaged in the Cardinals Letter, for hauing the reſt of the Aſſiſtants to be choſen in and neare about <hi>London,</hi> was expedient and very behouefull: we could not thinke that M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> or the Ieſuits would euer (in any ſuch ouert &amp; actual maner at leaſt) tranſgreſſe the direction and ſelfe-forme of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, had he, or they taken the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter</hi> to be the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his Holineſſe, and not for the plot of father <hi>Parſons,</hi> receiuing reputation by bearing the Cardinals name, but the thing it ſelfe left
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16974:31"/> wholly to the others order, framing, and direction.</p>
                  <p>Another proofe or preſumption, though not ſo forceably conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and which time (a good decypherer of matters) hath ſithence diſcouered, is the appearing of a ſecond forme of the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter</hi> as we take it, or at leaſt wiſe of a copie of the <hi>Conſtitutiue Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſubſcribed and ſigned with the Cardinals hand and ſeale, as was the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter</hi> it ſelfe. And that this is true, thus we make plaine. The <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter</hi> which M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> firſt ſhewed vnto vs, bore date the 7. of March, 1598. as himſelfe will not deny, nor can, if he then ſhewed vs the true Letter, becauſe the Popes Breue confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it by that date: and about ſome foure moneths after the attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made vpon the arriuall of his Holineſſe Breue, my ſelfe intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> for a ſight of the Cardinals Letter, to the end I might once throughly ſee (as wiſedome and conſcience did require) to what I was bound: he ſent me the Letter which is <hi>verbatim</hi> ſet downe in the beginning of the booke, and which was ſubſcribed and ſealed with the Cardinals name and ſignet: and his name ſo farre as we could geſſe (for moe Prieſts ſaw it beſide my ſelf) was written alſo with his Graces owne hand. But this Letter bore no date at all, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the day of the moneth, or yeare of our Lord, as I can wel proue (if it be denied) by ſufficient witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>And being in this maner infallibly ſure that there were two ſeueral <hi>Letters Conſtitutiue,</hi> both atteſted with the Cardinals hand and ſeale, the one with date, the other without date: and therefore not to be ſaid that the Cardinall out of his prouident wiſedome, ſent two Letters of one purport into England, to the end that if one miſcarried, the other might come to M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> his hand: for that a Letter bearing no date, can carry little credence, and conſequently not ſufficient to work ſo great and effect as was intended, the erection and eſtabliſhment of a ſubordination, both meerly penall, and without example from the beginning of the world.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, I for my part do not ſee the counter-euidence, why M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> and my ſelfe ſhould diſtruſt, or not rather truſt our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries agreeing both in one, and little doubt but the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter</hi> which M. <hi>Blackwel</hi> firſt ſhewed to vs both, differed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other which he ſithence ſent vnto me to reade. And not onely in the matter about chuſing the Aſſiſtants, but in another point alſo more importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: which was, that the offenders ſhould <hi>dicta cauſa,</hi> be heard to ſpeake &amp; anſwer for themſelues, before condemnation or puniſhment infflicted: a right
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16974:31"/> that nature and all lawes preſcribe. I vſe the Latine words (<hi>dicta cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi>) becauſe I ſeeme and haue ſince euer ſeemed to remember the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry words themſelues, which maketh me as in this, ſo in the former alſo the leſſe doubtfull by much, whether my memorie faileth me, yea or no in the ſaid particulars.</p>
                  <p>Neither can we yeeld a reaſon why fa <hi>Parſons</hi> or ſome other might not as well alter the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter</hi> in theſe points, as he or ſome other altered the ſentence of the two Cardinals, <hi>Caictane</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gheſo,</hi> in the exile &amp; confinement of our two brethren. And that their honours ſentence was altered in the copy, which was ſent into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland by fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> (vnles ſome other beſides fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> writeth to our Archprieſt of ſuch matters) &amp; which M. <hi>Blackwel</hi> read to M. <hi>Muſh</hi> &amp; me, &amp; ſhewed the ſame to others, is ſo apparant a truth, that M. <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> can in no ſort deny it. The ſentence in the originall was, that in vertue of holy obedience &amp; vnder cenſure of preſent ſuſpenſion from diuine offices, they ſhould not (<hi>pro tempore</hi> for a time) preſume to go into <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> without the expreſſe leaue of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe or the Lord Cardinall Protector: but in the copie it was thus changed, that vnder the foreſaid cenſure they ſhould not preſume to returne or go into any of the ſaid kingdomes for the ſpace of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. yeares. So that the wordes (<hi>pro tempore</hi> for a time) in the originall ſignifying an indefinit ſpace of time, were altered in the copy which was ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> went here currant &amp; none but it, into a determined &amp; ſet ſpace of time, contrary to the wordes of the originall, and more then could be collected out of the tenor, nor the ſentence euer ſo interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our brethren on whom it paſſed.</p>
                  <p>Now if fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> dealt thus boldly in the ſentence of the two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, what reaſon can be yeelded why we ſhould diſcredit our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories ſtanding vpon ſo many preſumptions, rather then thinke that fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> would ſtraine curteſie to change or get to be changed the <hi>Letter Conſtitutiue,</hi> a deuice and plot of his owne, and whereof he hath the whole managing.</p>
                  <p>That which we would adde further in this point, is: that his Holines confirming onely that Letter of the Cardinall which bore date the 7. of March, in which the abouenamed particulars were expreſſed (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe as is ſaid, our memories do wonderfully deceiue vs, whereof yet we haue no more doubt then of what we doubt leaſt) it followeth, if ſo the ſaid particulars were indeed expreſſed in the <hi>Conſtitutiue Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> which his Holineſſe confirmed, that the election of the Aſſiſtants

                  <p>The third and laſt principall reaſon, why we could not thinke the new ſubordination to be the ordinance of his Holineſſe, or appointed by his commaundement, was in reſpect of the rigours it contained, a note fartheſt remoued from his Holineſſe nature, and courſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. For inſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it appeared incredible that his Holineſſe tender compaſſion towardes the ſeuerall and heauieſt afflictions that the lawes of our Country lay vpon vs, would to the increaſe of our burthen inſtitute a meere penall iuriſdiction in our Church, carrying only power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh &amp; afflict vs more: yea, and in ſuch ſort (as we tooke the caſe) to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and afflict vs, as not after any condigne ſatisfaction and worthieſt amendment, the Superiour had authoritie to reſtore the offender,<note place="margin">24 q. 1. ca.

For although in Cenſures of holy Church regularly he that hath authoritie to bind, hath alſo authoritie to looſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wiſe he that hath authoritie to looſe, hath authoritie to bind:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16974:32"/> yet it followed not at leaſt in our vnderſtanding (the taking away of faculties being no cenſure) that becauſe the Archprieſt had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie giuen him to take away faculties, graunted by whom or whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, therefore he could giue or reſtore them againe, after he had once taken them away, in regard his authority being delegatine and after a preſcript forme it could not (at leaſt as we thought) be extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the caſes expreſſed. And therefore no expreſſe ſignification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made of any ſuch authority in the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter,</hi> that he might reſtore againe all ſuch faculties as he had for any cauſe taken away, we thought the ſubordination to be much more rigorous or defectiue in this point, then that it could be the ordinance or commandemement of his Holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond inſtance. It appeared incredible that his Holineſſe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo great commendation for mercifulneſſe and lenitie as he doth, would neuertheleſſe enact a new kind of puniſhment for the Prieſts of our countrey onely, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ighting in more bloud for maintaining the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignty of that Chaire, then any other Cleargy at this day in the world. We preſume to ſay a new kind of puniſhment for the Prieſts of our countrey only, becauſe the auncient and vſuall manner of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prieſts in other countries, that ſhew themſelues diſobedient, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, or ſtubborne, againſt their Eccleſiaſticall ſuperiours, is by impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of cenſures, that is by debarring them the vſe of their Prieſtly functions, not by taking their faculties quite from them. But in the new ſubordination, authoritie is giuen not onely to ſuſpend or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre vs from the vſe of our faculties, but as if that tye and puniſhment were too ſlight, or brought not miſery inough vpon vs, we muſt haue all our faculties taken quite and cleane from vs, giuen by whom and whenſoeuer. A kind of iuriſdiction ſeldome heard of, and neuer vſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any Paſtors, ſuch as al the Prieſts in our country are after a ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be, &amp; ſo named in the 9. Inſtruction. Nor was the iuriſdiction euer practiſed in England while good Cardinal <hi>Allen</hi> liued, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity taken vp only ſince Fa. <hi>Par.</hi> began to ſit at ſterne, &amp; therby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more bold to vnmaske his violent nature. Yea as M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> now demeaneth the matter, and ſayth he hath good warrant for it, not only al our faculties muſt be taken wholy away from vs vpon due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction of a fault, but the like proſecution muſt be made vpon vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out triall, without proofe, without ſummons, meerely at the arbitrary diſpoſition of himſelfe, that is (as the euent hath hitherto ſhewed) when &amp; ſo often as he ſhall imagine or be pleaſed to pretend a cauſe.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:16974:33"/>
                  <p>A third inſtance. We could not beleeue (the action being without an example in Gods Church) that his Holineſſe determining to make a ſuperiour ouer our whole ſecular Cleargy, would inſtitute no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a prelate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an Archprieſt to take the charge: eſpecially if his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe then meant ſo much, as in his later Breue is ſithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce appointed, that he ſhould alſo be a ſuperiour ouer the laity, as well honorable as worſhipfull. And not onely to gouerne all the ſecular Prieſts reſiding within the realme, but to gouerne, direct, and command vs if ſo we do or ſhall reſide in the kingdome of Scotland,</p>
                  <p>A ſcope which conuinced our vnderſtanding, that the ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not the appointment or decree of his Holineſſe, but ſome fine deſcant or politicke deuice plotted by father <hi>Parſons</hi> for ſeruing ſome turne appertaining to ſtate matters. We wiſh it were not ſo, but it is too plaine: for if conſideration of matters of this quality were laid aſide, what reaſon can be giuen that an Archprieſt reſiding in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, ſhould direct and gouerne his Countrey-prieſts in Scotland, where alſo no Engliſh Prieſts at the time of inſtituting the authority, or ſince is knowne to reſide? But father <hi>Parſons</hi> harbouring ſome watchfull bugs in his breſt, and forecaſting matters a farre off, thought it good wiſedome to preuent the contingent, which his owne feare or ſurmizes ſuggeſted, and to forelay what might fall in time: verify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein the words of our Sauiour, <hi>The children of this world, are</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> 
                     <hi>wiſer then the children of light in their generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fourth inſtance. On the one ſide it appeared ſtraunge, that his Holineſſe hauing ſet ſo long in the Chaire as he hath, and receiuing aduertiſements of the miſeries of our Church, could be ſo little wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the ſtate of Prieſtes and lay Catholikes in our countrey, as to thinke Prieſts might be remoued from one reſidence to another by authority, and not great and open daunger to enſue. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, if ſo his Holineſſe were ignorant of the lawes of our country, or did not vnderſtand the miſeries and dangers we liue in, what ſinne could our prolonging be, of not ſubiecting our ſelues to the new au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, till we had informed his Holineſſe therein, and ſhewed how inconuenient, nay how dangerous, or truer, how impoſſible it was for any ſuch iuriſdiction to be practiſed in our countrey, vnleſſe we did wilfully lay open, not onely our ſelues, but our Catholike friends to the hazards of a thouſand ieopardies? Let that point of the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the termes of our realme, and the nature of requiſite circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances be conſidered together, and the demonſtration is made of as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16974:33"/> much as is auerred.</p>
                  <p>We will here let paſſe in ſilence that one of the Aſſiſtants (the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits chiefe ſolicitor in forwarding this new authority at Rome) was the man, who firſt ſuggeſted that clauſe of remouing Prieſts from their places of reſidence to be inſerted in the iuriſdiction of the Archprieſt, alleadging ſuch a cauſe for his good deede, as howſoeuer his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſerued to tell it, yet our conſcience, and feare of preiudice to manie, eſpecially if the faculty ſhould happen to be practiſed as hath bene already threatned, will not giue vs leaue to recite it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the third writing to the Archbiſhop of <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>O Lord, who could thinke, the contrary being not ſeene and felt, that men of learning, men of religion, men that muſt be accounted of a paſſing mild ſpirite, would cenſure, adiudge and diuulge that action of ours to be ſo grieuous a crime as they made it, being in his nature no other, then which Popes themſelues haue decreed to be lawfull,

                  <p>To wade further, be it that we knew the Archpresbiterſhip and the iuriſdiction adioyned, to be the commaundement, or immediate act of his Holineſſe, as before the arriuall of his firſt Breue (the whole time of our bearing off) we n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> did, nor could win our thoughts to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any ſuch matter: what, muſt it by and by put on the nature of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormious diſobedience, and we wote not what elſe, to deferre the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the ſayd commaundement vpon manifeſt euidence of vntrue and moſt ignominious ſuggeſtion expreſſed in the front of the ſame Letter, wherein the commaundement it ſelfe was ſignified, and alledged alſo for the chiefe and ſole cauſe, why the ſubordination was inſtituted? Verily if ſuch auouance be throughly and vprightly looked into, there cannot but appeare in them matter of diſhonoring the Sea Apoſtolicke and ſupreme paſtours, as that hauing made forth their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, vpon information cannot, or muſt not, after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that any delay be made by the ſubiect in executing the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, how wrong &amp; detractiue ſoeuer they ſhall thinke, or know, the information to be: then which, what is farther from reaſon, or can deeper diſtaine?</p>
                  <p>But leauing to others to comment vpon the paradoxe, we deſire the aduerſarie that can ſay moſt in the cauſe, to particulate the reaſon, which in our duty and loue towards his Holineſſe, ſhould haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs to thinke that his mild and ſweet courſe of proceeding with all other nations, had ſo maruellouſly chaunged it ſelfe towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſant Catholikes of our Realme, his oppreſſed children, as to graunt authority to the Archprieſt to place and diſplace Prieſts in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, harboring them of charity, when but an inckling of receiuing any Prieſt into their houſe is matter inough to occaſion trouble, and the proofe or knowledge thereof a ſufficient cauſe vtterly to vndoe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; their whole family. A iuriſdiction therfore farre more inconuenient &amp; hurtfull, then we could any way beleeue his Holineſſe euer appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: nay our vnderſtanding gaue vs that we could not but with breach of bounden duty thinke that his Holineſſe would euer aſſigne ſuch a faculty as we for the foreſayd cauſe and preiudice, as alſo for that it giueth authority to the Archprieſt to diſpoſe of the perſons of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prieſts, a thing neuer heard of: yea in the conſequence to diſpoſe of our liues too, in regard that all Catholike houſes, whither he may remoue vs, be not alike ſafe and free from danger.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:16974:34"/>
                  <p>What ſhall we ſay? We could no way imagine that this ſo rare &amp; ample iuriſdiction came from any other then from the heads of father <hi>Garnet</hi> and fathers <hi>Parſons,</hi> as bearing the right ſtampe of father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> nature, and ſorting with other his forcible pollicies. For by inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the Archprieſt (their owne at commaundement) with this ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne kind of iuriſdiction, they knew they had a meane alwayes ready at hand, to helpe when they would, their brethren the Ieſuites and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their deuoted friends to the beſt places in our Realme, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, to draw to their party ſuch of the laity, as they would faineſt haue to comply and aduance their proceedings: Firſt by remouing the Prieſt they keepe, if he be thought an impediment thereunto, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by placing another Prieſt in his roome, who muſt prepare and win them, in the maner he ſhall be directed.</p>
                  <p>A fifth inſtance. It ſeemed moſt improbable vnto vs, that his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe knowing in what deepe diſgrace we liue with our Prince, and in what vtter contempt and ſcorne with the greater number of our Realme by infinite (and this for no cauſe more, if for any ſo much, as for honouring and maintaining the ſupreme dignity of that Chaire) would neuertheleſſe, adde this hard fauour and increaſe of diſhonour to our other afflictions: as that we ſhould in no chaunge, haue the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our ſuperiour, but the Cardinall Protector (a ſtraunger, and who being a chiefe patrone of our oppoſitors, hath ſhewed himſelfe alwayes a backe friend to our party) ſhould without any of our voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the leaſt aduice taken from vs, euermore of himſelfe appoint our Archprieſt. A greater diſguſt then we could perſwade our ſelues, that his Holineſſe for the compaſſion and reſpect he beareth toward our miſeries, would euer ſhew, ſpecially to our whole Cleargy.</p>
                  <p>And certes we could not recken this ſo ſtraunge a prouiſo, but for a cunning deuiſe of they two foreſayd Ieſuites, both to preuent that none might be choſen to the place, but ſuch as themſelues ſhould well like, and haue the preferring of, and by the interſeſſion and meane of this fauour beſtowed, euermore to make themſelues the proprietaries and commanders of our Archprieſt, and haue him ready to execute all their deſignes: puniſh, remoue, diſgrace, whom, when, and how they ſhould appoint.</p>
                  <p>In briefe, the ſpeeches that M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> himſelfe vſed not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the receit of the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter,</hi> bred at that time an aſſured o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in vs, that the authority he claimed, was not the inſtitution of his Holineſſe. The ſpeeches were theſe: [That if we would accept of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16974:35"/> the ſubordination appointed, and ſhould obediently demeane our ſelues thereunto, his Holineſſe intended, after ſome triall of our cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age vnder this forme of gouernement, to make Biſhops in our Church, and to allow them as large pentions as the reuenewes of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprickes in our countrey amounted to in a Catholicke time.] Which words ſounding very vnlikely in our eares, what could we in reaſon thinke, but that, if the authority had bene the act of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſuch groſſe inducements little needed: and conſequently the vſing of them did more and more confirme vs, that the ſubordination was only a platforme of the Ieſuites, put in execution by the Cardinall without any commandement of his Holineſſe, for erecting the ſame in particular with the faculties adioyned.</p>
                  <p>And to make this of the more probability, there occurred three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeciall preſumptions, the one was certaine ſpeeches, vttered by a Senior Aſſiſtant: The ſecond, the deuiſing of [<hi>Olim dicebamur</hi>] for<note place="margin">A letter of thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing the eighth of Nouember 1599.</note> gathering of names: The third, the order of ſwearing Prieſtes of the Colledges ere they ſhould haue faculties giuen them for England.</p>
                  <p>Touching the firſt, maiſter <hi>Terwit</hi> the ſecond Senior Aſſiſtant very inward with the Ieſuites in moſt of the affaires ſpake (as we were told) vpon what occaſion himſelfe better knoweth, that the new authority, meaning the ſubordination was but to continue for a yeare or two, being only procured for curbing maiſter <hi>Muſh</hi> and <hi>Collington,</hi> with a few others. Which words howſoeuer we deſerued them at his hands (as I for my part neuer ſaw the man in England but once, and then, but for a dinner while onely, when alſo there paſſed no occaſion to my knowledge, that might conceit him ſo hardly againſt me, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary) yet they could not but giue vs cauſe to doubt, &amp; the more we knew him to be great with Fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> &amp; Fa. <hi>Garnet</hi> (the only archcontriuers of the ſubordination) the better ground we thought we had to beleeue the ſpeeches, and his words being true, we aſſured our ſelues that the ſubordination was not the act nor comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of his Holineſſe: for then, it could no way probably be in their power to let it dye in the time mentioned, as it did eaſily lye in their power to let it fall at the end of that time, if the ſubordination were the meere ordinance of the Cardinall his grace, he being ſo neare alyed in affection to father <hi>Parſons</hi> in particular, and to the whole body of the ſociety in generall.</p>
                  <p>Touching the ſecond. The Ieſuits or our Archprieſt, either, or both aduertiſing father <hi>Parſons</hi> that ſome refuſed to receiue the ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16974:35"/> and excepted againſt the Cardinall Protector his letter, as inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to eſtabliſh the kind of gouernement it appointed: What did father <hi>Parſons</hi> but preſently inuented (as notice was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs) this peece of ſineneſſe, that forſooth his friends here, the Archprieſt and the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, ſhould frame a letter of thankſgiuing to his Holineſſe for inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting of the new ſubordination in our Church, and procure the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of as many Prieſts hands thereunto as they could.

                  </p>
                  <p>To which letter (of like for the better drawing on of others to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) the Ieſuites who were not within the liſts of the ſubordination, did firſt of all put to their names. Neither did their charity or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe content it ſelfe with this, but as, if the blame ſhould haue lighted onely on them, if any had bene ſlacke or neglected the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, they and their friends ſpared no labour or perſwaſion of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and ſoliciting others to giue their names: yea the buſineſſe was ſo effectually proſecuted, as ſome were made to beleeue it was ſinne, others told to be ſchiſme not to giue their names, and all brought to beleeue, that his Holineſſe looked to receiue thankes.</p>
                  <p>Strange, that the greateſt perſonage in the world, an old man, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, holy, humble, wiſe, cumbred with a thouſand affaires, ſo as he can hardly giue audience to heare matters of waight, ſhould looke to receiue thankes, and in a letter ſubſcribed with two or three hundreth names, and for conferring no greater a benefit then for commanding Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> to inſtitute an Archprieſt with iuriſdiction only to puniſh (for at that time maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> had no other authority) ſuch as were before ouerwhelmed in miſerie, and euery houre in daunger of leeſing their liues, for defending the diuine rights of his Papacy, &amp; for maintaining Chriſts truth, and the noblieſt cauſe vpon earth. And with whoſe names muſt this letter be ſubſcribed? with a Catalogue of names of poore Prieſts, diſtreſſed perſons, beggars, neither knowne, nor euer heard of by his Holineſſe, and diſtant by more then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles from him.</p>
                  <p>But had his Holineſſe expected or exacted thankes at the Prieſtes hands of our country, yet who would thinke that our Archprieſt and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:16974:36"/> the twelue Aſſiſtants, being our heads, and conſequently the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall perſons in our body, had not beene a competent and ſufficient number, or at the moſt with ſixe or ten other of the ancienteſt Prieſts, to haue ioyned in ſuch a letter of humbling thankes to his Holineſſe in their owne, and in the behalfe of the reſt. Or admit it be <hi>decorum</hi> to ſubſcribe ſuch a multitude of names in a letter to his Holineſſe, and in no greater affaire then to giue him thankes, yet the procuring of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Prieſts name mattered little, but was rather ſuperfluous or a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the reſt giuing thankes in the perſon of all, except his Holineſſe ſhould haue taken tale how many by name had thanked him.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould maruell if father <hi>Garnet</hi> and father <hi>Parſons</hi> did not laugh in their ſleeue, notwithſtanding themſelues were the plotters of the deuice, when they ſaw the ouerſight of our brethren, and how eaſily moſt of vs were won to giue thanks for a ſubordination, being a ſtaffe for themſelues, their deputies, and ſucceſſours, to beate vs withall at their pleaſure, except we did ſtill ſing <hi>placebo,</hi> and bow downe our neckes to what yoake ſoeuer their enterpriſing natures thought meet to lay vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>But howſoeuer they delighted themſelues with this, yet if father <hi>Parſons</hi> were made acquainted with all particulars, he could not but wiſh that maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> had vſed ſome better pretence for ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding three Prieſts from the vſe of their faculties, then becauſe they would not vpon his command confirme, <hi>his authority vnder their hand</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The words of our Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſts letter of the 4. of Aprill 1599. which is ſet downe in the booke to the Inquiſition.</note> 
                     <hi>writing, as a certaine witneſſe of their obedience, and by putting too their names:</hi> the Prieſts the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues knew not to what, vnleſſe it were to [<hi>olim dicebamur.</hi>] A cauſe we dare ſay, that ſince the beginning of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, there was neuer Prieſt ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded for the like. For the ſubiect to be puniſhed becauſe he wil not confirme the authority of his Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſuperiour vnder his hand writing (an exaction of al incongruency, for what inferiour can confirme the authority of his ſuperiour, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an office of a ſuperiour to the ſuperiour) or put his name to a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of thankſgiuing for a new increaſe of ſubiection, is a courſe ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon and iuſtice, and ſo repugnant in it ſelfe, as it can hardly admit any colour, cloake or euaſion.</p>
                  <p>Neither in truth do we thinke that the rendering of thankes to his Holineſſe was the ground, and true cauſe indeed why ſo many names were gathered with like ado: but rather that the impulſiue and reall cauſe thereof, was, for that the Ieſuits hauing deuiſed the authority to ſubordinate (as it ſeemeth) our whole Cleargy to themſelues by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:16974:36"/> chuſing and directing the Archprieſt, got the Cardinall Protector to erect the ſame by his letter, not doubting but that by the place and power of the Cardinall, we would all ſwallow the hooke. But ſeeing themſelues deceiued in the conceit, they threw about with ſpeed how they might beare out the action, and in fine maugre the might of ſuch as withſtood them, atchieue their deſire (a deſire perchance neither a little nor a ſhort while lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged after) &amp; reſolued: that a Letter of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing ſhould be drawne to his Holines, and as many Prieſts labored, as the Arihprieſt, themſelues, and their friends could preuaile with, to put to their names, that ſo hauing once gotten their names, fa. <hi>Parſons</hi> might after vſe them to his Holineſſe and the Cardinals, for a proofe and conteſtation of the Prieſtes great willingneſſe and applauſe to the ſubordination, and that they all with one voice intreated the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof: when the truth was that moſt of thoſe, or rather all (a very few excepted) who gaue their names, would neuer haue done it, but vpon conceit that his Holines had already decreed the ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and did full heartily repent the folly when it was paſt, and they ſaw the pollicie.</p>
                  <p>Loe, the onely ground and true cauſe impulſiue and finall, and which deeds themſelues haue ſithence witneſſed, of framing (<hi>olim dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bamur</hi>) of gracing it with the Ieſuites names in the firſt ranke, and of procuring the ſubſcriptions of Prieſts therunto, with greateſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, importunitie, and with all ſorts of poſtulation. Lo alſo one force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able motiue, which then induced vs to thinke that the ſubordination was neither the commaundement, nor the ordinance of his Holineſſe: for then what needed the like ſhifts of deſcant or ſo much cunning, or plainer, ſo guilefull a proiect and proſecution?</p>
                  <p>To come now to the other preſumption of ſwearing of Prieſtes, or binding them by ſolemne promiſe to obey the Archprieſt, ere they may haue faculties giuen them in the Colledges from whence they are ſent. Which exaction or conſtrained oath, we tooke to be moſt need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, had the ſubordination bene the ordinance of his Holineſſe and ſo knowne. For who can in reaſon or with good conſcience doubt, whether the Prieſts that come into England vpon zeale with perill of life, to reduce others to the obedience of the Sea Apoſtolike, would in themſelues as ring-leaders, firſt abandon the ſame by withdrawing their bounden obedience from any Superiour, whom they ſhould know, or probably vnderſtand to be lawfully appointed ouerthem? So that the hearing of this exaction, did ſo little ſtagger and appale vs
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:16974:37"/> in our conceiued opinion, as it much fortified, and brought vs in a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough beleefe, that the ſubordination was not the act or commaund of his Holineſſe. For if it had bene, and that it could haue bene ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, (as if it had bene either, it might moſt eaſily haue bene proued) no doubt but wiſedome, loue, and charitie, in the Rectors of the Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges would haue inuited ſpecially father <hi>Parſons,</hi> both in reſpect he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Rome, when the ſubordination was graunted, and gouerned al or the chiefeſt Colledges, rather to haue giuen ſatisfaction and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall ſertitude of the ſubordination it ſelfe to the Prieſtes, then through default thereof to leaue them doubtfull in mind, and oblige their conſciences by oath.</p>
                  <p>And when was it euer ſeene, that any much leſſe Prieſts, the franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed children in Gods houſe, ſhould be compelled to ſweare obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, before they knew, or any legall or ſufficient proofe made bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to know (as neither was done) that the party to whom they ſhould ſweare obedience was their ſuperiour?</p>
                  <p>To ſhut vp this our ſecond reaſon, we will grant to our aduerſaries, that his Holines commanded a ſubordination, and inioyned the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall moſt directly to ordaine gouernement among vs, as to our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the ſame did not appeare in any part of the Cardinals Letter and his Holineſſe Breue was not then extant (for no ſooner was it extant, but that we preſently ſubmitted our ſelues without the leaſt exception or repugnancy) yet the principall marke and end of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, being to eſtabliſh peace, no doubt his beſſed fatherhoods will and pleaſure was, that ſuch a ſubordination &amp; forme of gouernement ſhould be inſtituted, as might auaile to the making and continuance of peace. Therefore the Archpresbyterſhip accompanied with no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite at all, but onely with iuriſdiction to afflict vs, as namely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine or ſuſpend our faculties, to take them quite away, to remoue vs from our places of reſidence, to commaund what he liſteth, and as the authoritie is now practiſed to ſuſpend, from vſe of al Prieſtly function, to interdict both Cleargie and Laitie, to multiply Decrees vpon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and in ſuch maner and matter, as if we were no longer <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the free woman, but of the bond woman,</hi> and our ſtate and perſons<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> become ſo ſeruile, as there remaineth no right in vs to reſiſt any iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, defamation, or oppreſſion ſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>Now if this kind of ſubordination bringing no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie with it, but all plentie of diſcommodities, hurts, and annoyances, be, or could be, a meane to make peace, the motiue and end of inſtituting the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16974:37"/> authoritie, or as much as tend that way in it ſelfe, or not rather yeeld occaſion of hafting new quarrels, a thing quite contrarie to his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes deſigne in graunting the delegation to the Cardinall: not only our wits and iudgements, but common reaſon alſo, is vtterly eclipſed in vs. For we confeſſe, we cannot ſee how by common reaſon, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare likely to any man of iudgement, that peace would folow, or that peace could be any way effected (which the ſequel hath hitherto verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) by the erecting of this ſubordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> including the ſeminary Prieſts onely, while the totall maſſe and life of the whole contention, was not betweene the ſeminarie Prieſts among themſelues, or betweene them and the Laitie, but betwixt ſome of the ſecular Prieſts and the Ieſuits, ouer whom the Archprieſt hath ſo little iuriſdiction, as the chiefe of the Ieſuits is by a ſpeciall prouiſo added to the Cardinals Letter, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after a ſort in commiſſion with the Archprieſt, in that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt is directed by vertue of the ſaid Inſtruction, to do nothing of waight, without the priuitie and aduice of the other.</p>
                  <p>What more plaine, then if two be at variance, the meane of accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them by authoritie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e is, nor can be, by hauing iuriſdiction and command ouer one of them, and none at all ouer the other, but by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying authoritie ouer both, as our Archprieſt doth not.</p>
                  <p>Againe, what equitie or iuſtice, (the parent, Nurſe, and preſeruer of peace,) can any one in reaſon exſpect, when he that is moſt engaged in the difference, and a party alſo, is appointed Counſellor and aduiſer to the Iudge, &amp; the Iudge preſcribed to do nothing of moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him? Too ſtrange a forme of Iuſtice, as we thought, for his Holines to be the ſetter downe of, and ſo vnfit a meane to peace, as what can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and further contention moſt.</p>
                  <p>Touching alſo the compoſing of the diſſention, pretended to be betweene the ſecular Prieſts and the lay Catholickes, this authoritie appeared in like maner very defectiue in the means of taking it away, if there had bene ſuch a difference, in regard the Cardinals Letter gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Archprieſt onely authoritie ouer the Seminarie Prieſts, and maketh not euen the leaſt mention of any iuriſdiction or power giuen him ouer the laitie, as he that peruſeth the <hi>Constitutiue Letter</hi> (the true and ſole liſts of his whole authoritie) cannot but ſee.</p>
                  <p>Or if any will ſhew themſelues to be of ſo weake iudgement, (as once a ſpeciall Agent of our aduerſaries did, vpon warrantiſe as he ſaid from father <hi>Parſons</hi>) as to auow, that the Archprieſt holding au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer the Prieſts, Confeſſours to the Laitie, he holdeth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16974:38"/> authoritie ouer their ghoſtly children, it were vndoubtedly a ſtrange conſequence, and which bringeth a new doctrine into the world. For hereby it cannot but follow, that when a religious man (a thing moſt common) is Confeſſor to a King, or Pope; the chiefe of the houſe or companie whereof the religious man is a member, hauing by the rules and vow of religion iuriſdiction ouer the Confeſſor: he hath likewiſe iuriſdiction by this reaſon ouer the King, or Pope, to whom the ſaid religious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ghoſtly father. But let the ſequel be good, as in common reaſon it is moſt abſurd, yet euen in this maner the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is in it ſelfe farre ſhort of effecting peace. For not all the Lay Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes, and moſt probably not ſuch, between whom and the Prieſts the contention was, or was like to be, are vnder the charge of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie Prieſts, but vnder the guiding of the Ieſuits, and conſequently no whit at all vnder the iuriſdiction of the Archprieſt, if the former doctrine were currant, that he that retaineth iuriſdiction ouer the Confeſſor, retaineth iuriſdiction ouer his ghoſtly children.</p>
                  <p>Further, theſe that were in this maner vnder the direction of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie Prieſts, were not, neither would be, nor perhaps could be ſo tied to continue with them, but that they would leaue them at their pleaſure, and when they thought good. Nay it cannot be doubted but they, meeting with ſuch an occaſion, would not faile to change their ghoſtly father, and go to confeſſion to the Ieſuits for ridding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from all ſuch authoritie of the Archprieſt. An inconuenience as none greater, and which by likelihood would in ſhort while, ſet our whole Church on fire. Wherefore the authoritie of the Archprieſt appearing vnto vs, neither auaileable to the making of peace between the ſecular Prieſts and the Catholicke laitie, if they had bene at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as it was ſuggeſted: neither a meane to attone the debates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Ieſuits and the Prieſts, which was concealed: and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe motiue and intent of commaunding a ſubordination to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, being a pious and zealous deſire of according all differences, and making perfect peace: it ſeemed cleare vnto vs, that his Holineſſe neuer meant, that this kind of ſubordination afflicting onely, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering nothing els but the increaſe of our miſeries, ſhould be brought into our Church: but ſome other more profitable kind of regiment, that might encourage, ſtrengthen, and ſupport the naturall infirmities of man, in theſe troubles and hote times of Catholike triall. All which conſiderations and precedent profes, did more then problably aſſure vs, that it could hide neither offence before God or man, and leſſe the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16974:38"/> crimes obiected, to deferre our abſolute ſubmiſſion, vntill ſuch time as his Holineſſe ſhould make knowne his particular commaundement, or ratifie and approoue the Cardinals act after ſome authenticall manner.</p>

To make an Archprieſt ſuperiour ouer the Cleargie of a whole Realme, to direct, to reprehend, to chaſtice, and preſcribe as he liſteth vnto them: to remoue them alſo from their places of reſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the ſame being in temporall mens houſes, and of almes: and not onely in this nature to commaund them, while they reſide in the ſame kingdome with him, but alſo to hold &amp; exerciſe the ſame iuriſdiction ouer them,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16974:39"/> if ſo they reſide in an other kingdome, gouerned by an other Prince, and diſtant by many hundreth miles from the place of the others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode. Theſe are ſo rare nouelties without example in holy Church, as no proues, but ſuch as are legall, can ſeeme warrantable or ſufficient i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the caſe.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this very point which we are now entring into, is the hardeſt knot in the whole controuerſie, &amp; in which the principall iſſue moſt lieth, we thinke good for the more perſpicuitie of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, firſt to make a diuiſion of the meanes, by which the Cardinall might receiue authoritie from his Holineſſe, to conſtitute ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination in our Church. And then, to proue that his Graces Letter (whether patent or ſealed, as to my remembrance it came ſealed vp according to the Romane maner with a labell) was no ſuch proofe as could either in law or conſcience bind vs to admit the ſubordination appointed without further ſpecialty of ſuch his Holines Commiſſion vnto him, then the credence and teſtimonie of his Graces Letter ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther patent or cloſe ſealed.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, it ſeemeth cleere that his Grace receiued autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from his Holineſſe, to conſtitute an Arch prieſt ouer vs, either by way offormall delegation, or by way of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion by word of mouth. This is ſo euident and manifeſt by the tenor of the Conſtitutiue Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (if a commaundement to make peace, be a Commiſſion to inſtitute an Archprieſt) that if our aduerſaries ſhall gaine-ſay it, they ſeeme not to loue truth, but rather to affect contention.</p>
               <p>And if his Grace receiued authoritie from his Holineſſe by way of formal delegation, then his Grace not ſhewing vs the Popes reſcript, or a conteſtified copy thereof for teſtimonie of the delegation, we were not bound by law or conſcience, to admit the ſubordination vpon the ſole credence of his Graces Letter patent or cloſe ſealed.</p>

And the third falleth in as little with our caſe, becauſe liuing by the vſe of our faculties, it cannot be, but a very great, direct, and immediate preiudice to be depriued of them, meerely at the arbitrary pleaſure of another, without iuridicall proofe or lawfull conuiction of any condigne or proportionable demerit. Which preiudice appeareth alſo by ſo much the greater or more infinite, as the retaining and vſe of our faculties, are the ableſt, if not the ſole meanes both of gaining and releeuing ſoules, the end why we tooke Prieſthood vpon vs, a profeſſion in ſo great diſlike and perſecution with the ſtate.</p>
               <p>Againe, what more apparant preiudice either to Prieſts or to the Catholike laity, then that authority ſhould be giuen (the ſtraight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the lawes of our Realme conſidered) to change and remoue Prieſts from one reſidence to another, we being indued with no Church liuing, nor the lay Catholikes bound by as much as the leaſt ſhew of charity, to maintaine any one in their houſes, but ſuch as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſhall chuſe or caſt affection vnto, in regard they muſt venter therein the vtter looſing of all their goods, life, ſtate, &amp; the ouerthrow of their whole poſterity. And neither muſt they make this venter for a weeke, two, or three, but muſt ſet downe their dwelling in the hazards of the caſualty, ſo long as they entertaine the Prieſt, and euer after du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their liues, and the lawes of the preſent ſtate.</p>
               <p>Moreouer can a ſeparation be made by authority of the Poſtour from the flocke: of the Guide from the charge: of the Prieſt reſiant from his acquaintance and place of aboad, and no ſpeeches to grow and be ſpread thereof? Moſt improbable. And not much leſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely is it, but that the walking vp and downe of ſuch ſpeeches in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mens mouthes, will quickly lay open the ſtate of ſuch Catholikes from whom they are, and to whom they ſhal be in ſuch ſort remoued, to danger, hauocke, and ruine.</p>
               <p>Another preiudice, and which doth not ſo much directly follow v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſubordination, as it is intrinſecall and incorporate thereunto, the preiudice being expreſly and by ſpeciall prouiſo enacted in the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter</hi> itſelfe; to weete, that the nomination and chuſing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16974:42"/> of the Archprieſt, ſhould not appertaine (notwithſtanding the large iuriſdiction and commaund he carrieth ouer all) either to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the twelue Aſſiſtants, or to the whole body of Prieſtes within our Realme, who are to obey and liue vnder his rules, but that in euery change of the Archprieſt, either by death, apprehenſion, leauing the Realme, or other accident, the ſucceſſour is to be aſſigned by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Grace onely, a forrainer to our nation, aparted by many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth of miles from vs, a ſtranger to our affaires, and neither acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all the ſorts of our preſſures, nor with their meaſure and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. Which prouiſo ſeemed alſo the more ſtraight and preiudicial vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, in reſpect the Cardinall Protector was like to receiue no other information, to direct his honour in the election of the next Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, but that which father <hi>Garnet</hi> and father <hi>Parſons</hi> the authours of all our troubles, and the maiſter parties of the one ſide of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſhould then againe ſuggeſt, and rule all in the ſecond, third, and euery change, as they did in the election of M. <hi>Blackwell,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our poore cleargie neuer lacke matter of diſturbance, vnleſſe we accommodate and proſtrate our ſelues to father <hi>Parſons</hi> humour and the direction of the Ieſuits in all things.</p>
               <p>And here we cannot but wiſh to God that father <hi>Parſons</hi> pollicie and the ſeeking of himſelfe, would once at length redound more then it doth, to the good of our Church and Countrey: we meane his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pollicie in preuenting that none of our nation come to prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or credite in the Court of Rome, or haue meanes to enforme his Holines of the true ſtate of matters, but that himſelfe muſt be the ſole agent and informer, or ſome ſuch his creatures as ſhall not faile to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond his driftes, and runne in one and his owne currant with him.</p>

               <p>At the firſt, whiles we liued without a Superiour, it might perhaps ſeeme no great disfauour to haue a Superior appointed vnto vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our aſſent, or priuitie, or voice, or aduice in the election: but now when we appeare in a ſort collegiated, by liuing all in obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Superior, and vnder a receiued and ſet forme of gouernement, to haue the ſame meaſure and disfauour neuertheleſſe continued, yea to haue the continuance thereof expreſly and by particular caution enacted, it cannot but be deemed a preiudice by any vpright iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a much higher diſgrace and impeachment to our whole Church, then (as we hope) our long trauailes, the burden of our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, the waight of our other preſſures, the daily venturing of our liues for the gaine of ſoules, the ſtore of bloud we haue that way yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the fruite which hath come therof, and our maintaining the rights of the Romane ſea, either haue, or by Gods grace with our wittingnes euer ſhall deſerue of <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, or at the hands of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                  <p>And firſt it is cleere by the authoritie aboue rehearſed out of <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetius, Panormitane, Speculator, Felinus, Egidius, Bellemera, Bouerus, Zecchius, Conradus,</hi> the very choiſe of both the ancient and moderne Canoniſts, that all Papall delegation eſpecially communicating iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in penall matters, muſt of neceſſitie, ere any be bound to obey, be firſt proued either by ſhewing the reſcript of the delegation, or an authenticall copie thereof.

                  <p>Which reaſon alſo ſeemeth as ſtrongly to conclude that the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and iuriſdiction giuen to the Archprieſt, and particularized partly in the Conſtitutiue Letter, partly in the inſtructions, and partly in the additions, being many in number, and diſtinct without dependance each of other, cannot well for the ſame cauſe and fickleneſſe of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, be proued by witneſſes, but rather require for due proofe the ſhewing and comparing of an authenticke note, or abſtract of the things in particular, which were graunted to the Archprieſt or Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall by his Holineſſe, which hitherto we neuer ſaw, nor heard tell of, nor, which perhaps was euer extant, notwithſtanding the iuſt neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof.

For if this large ſcope were once in vre and admitted, the next may be to bid all order farewell, as wherein diſcipline is rifled, tyrannie ſet free, the practiſe of holy Church turned vpſide downe, and the arayes of all Chriſtian peace and quietneſſe vtterly broken: in regard it followeth hereby, that whoſoeuer can prooue a delegation or commiſſion, may forthwith incroch and challenge therupon to order all matters, either out or in his commiſſion, as he liſteth, without reſtraint, limit, checke, or gaineſtanding of any, as hauing by the former ſcope authoritie for his warrant: which is ſo very abſurd, that he ſcarcely deſerueth the name of a man, and leſſe the praiſe of ſcholerſhip, who ſhall ſhew himſelfe ſo very a babe as once to affirme it.</p>
                  <p>And now here we demand, who in the rankes of the foreſayd wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes (which are yet all that our aduerſaries themſelues claime wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of) doth in his record deſcend to the ſpecifying of any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular contained in the commiſſion? Let the teſtimonies be reuiewed and compared with the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter,</hi> and we are content to make the aduerſary, who is moſt againſt vs, our Iudge in the caſe. For to begin with the firſt and take them all in order: The ſecond letter of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16974:45"/> Cardinall <hi>Caietane,</hi> which is ſet downe <hi>verbatim</hi> in the beginning of<note place="margin">Angles. p. 2. in 4 q. de reſt. leg. paenal. diff. 1. con. 1.</note> the booke (were it not contrary to the naturall forme of iuſtice ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued among all nations, be they Chriſtians, Iewes, or Pagans, for any one in the exterior Court to beare witneſſe in his owne cauſe) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther auerreth nor ſpecifieth any one particular of his Holineſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion vnto him, other then the commiſſion it ſelfe in generall termes, as all men may be their owne informers that will reade the Letter.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer there be certaine clauſes or points interlaced in the ſayd Letter, which did ſo little inuite vs to beleeue the reſidue therein mentioned, or what his Grace had written before in the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter,</hi> as they moſt mightily, more then euer before, cauſed vs to doubt of the proceſſe. For ſome part of the contents curteouſly fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth fault with maiſter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> for that he had not written to Rome of our manners or actions in ſo long while, and rendering his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, layeth it in his modeſty and charitie, in that he would not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily moued to accuſe his brethren: a property wherein one of his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt facilities did, and doth conſiſt, as we then knew, and haue ſithence more abundantly felt: nor can himſelfe deny this much, and father <hi>Parſons</hi> letter to maiſter Doctor <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the ninth of October 1599. and the late Apologie do verifie it apparantly.</p>
                  <p>Another peece of the letter impoſeth a commaundement or two vpon our Archprieſt, both to certifie the names, manners, and actions of the tumultuous, and the cauſes which they pretend of their relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, for ſo the letter termeth vs, and the iuſtifiable demaund we made for Canonicall proofe of his Holineſſe commiſſion, ere we did abſolutely engage and ſubiect our ſelues therunto. Iniunctions which certes we could not beleeue nor ſuſpect to proceed from order of his Holineſſe, notwithſtanding ſo much was expreſly ſignified in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. [<hi>Nunc tamen S<hi rend="sup">mo</hi> id poſtulante, vt informatio debita de omnibus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beatur faciendum tibi erit omnino.</hi> Yet now his Holineſſe commanding the ſame that due information be giuen of all, you muſt needes do it.]</p>
                  <p>The reaſons why we could not beleeue or ſuſpect thus much, were: firſt becauſe his Holineſſe was at <hi>Ferrara</hi> three hundreth miles, or thereabout from Rome at the time when the Cardinals letter was written: for his graces letter bore date from Rome the tenth of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember 1598. and his Holineſſe maried the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> at <hi>Ferrara</hi> on the 12. of the ſame moneth, two dayes after the date. Againe, his Holineſſe for a good while before
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16974:46"/> had not bene in Rome, being in his iourney towards <hi>Ferrara,</hi> nor was the Cardinall one of his attendants in the iourney. And to thinke that aduertiſements of like quality, and ſmall moment, as this buſineſſe of ours was, paſſed this while too, and fro, betweene his Holineſſe, and the Cardinall, were a very improbable conceit, conſidering the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall trauell of his Holineſſe, and the hourely acceſſe of all ſorts of people vnto him, and for that his Holineſſe intended ere long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to Rome, where the Cardinall might haue perſonall conference with him about the affaire, and in time conuenient inough, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being but onely to inquire how a few poore Prieſtes haue liued, and to vnderſtand from their aduerſaries the cauſes they pretend, in diſlike of a gouernement already in being.</p>
                  <p>And albeit theſe were the reſpects which inclined vs to doubt whether his Holineſſe enioyned any ſuch commaundement as the letter ſpecified, yet that which indeed farre more ſetled the doubt in our thoughts, was the partiality or iniuſtice, in that our aduerſaries, and thoſe that made a chiefe party, and were moſt intereſſed in the controuerſie, ſhould haue the certifying of what we could ſay either in clearing of our ſelues, or againſt them, and ſo haue the telling of both tales, theirs, and ours. Beſide, it ſeemed ſtraunge that we being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed but of one crime (if it be a defamation and a crime to do as the<note place="margin">Ca. ſi quando de poteſt. iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis deleg.</note> lawes of holy Church licence and direct when doubt is made either of the commiſſion, or of the ſpecialties therein contained) we muſt haue our manners or actions without any ſpecification of, or in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ranſacked, and layd open to the world. The firſt kind of partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie or iniuſtice not tollerated among the Heathens, and the later (if by our manners and actions the courſe of our life be meant, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception taken againſt the negotiators and other our brethren do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie) as contrary as what may be moſt contrary to the expreſſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Sea Apoſtolicke. <hi>Inquiſitio fieri debet ſolummodo ſuper illis</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ca. inquiſitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis de accuſat. § ad haec &amp; ca. qualiter el. 2. eodem.</note> (<hi>criminibus) de quibus clamores aliqui praeceſſerunt.</hi> Inquiſition ought onely to be made concerning thoſe crimes of which ſome clamorours reports haue gone before.</p>
                  <p>That maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> was willed to make inquiſition of our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or actions by way of authority, and conſequently by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, the words of the ſayd letter do atteſtate. For the Cardinall hauing before ſignified the Popes commandement to maiſter <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> that he ſhould not faile but ſend notice of our names<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> manners, or actions, his grace immediatly addeth: <hi>Quod vt facilius citiuſque ex no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrae
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16974:46"/> ordinationis authoritate perficias, hoc tibi caeteriſque Preſbyteris iniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus vt ſtatim ac diligenter fiat.</hi> The which thing, that you may by the authority of our ordination performe with the more eaſe and ſpeede, this we enioyne you and the reſt of the Prieſtes, that it be foorthwith and diligently accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt we would inferre of the premiſes is, that theſe things being part of the contents of the Letter, and ſounding ſo hardly both againſt the common forme of iuſtice, &amp; the decrees of Gods Church, we could not imagine, either the ſame to be written by any order re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from his Holineſſe, or written at all by the Cardinall, but we tooke the letter for an extrauagant of father <hi>Parſons,</hi> ſubſcribed by the Cardinall without peruſing it before, only vpon confidence of father <hi>Parſons</hi> iudgement and ſincerity in managing the affaire he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. Neuertheleſſe we can but muſe, why father <hi>Parſons</hi> would haue other mens liues and actions informed, when if his owne life and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition were vnripped, they would perchance bring as little edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the world, as the life and tranſgreſſions of ſome other. But the old ſaying is, <hi>Non videmus manticae quod in tergo eſt,</hi> we do not ſee the part of the wallet that hangeth behind, where, father <hi>Parſons</hi> of likelihood (as this his forwardneſſe ſhould ſhew) hath bundled vp the frailties of his owne life, and there keepeth them without looking on them, and thereby commeth to haue leiſure and appetite to gaze vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the life and cariages of ſome of the ſecular. But to proceed in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the reſt of the teſtimonies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly his Holineſſe <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>Flaunders</hi> in his Letter to maiſter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> and which our aduerſaries alleage as a teſtimony againſt vs, made no mention at all of the tenor of the commiſſion, nor of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular that ſhould be contained therein. Our aduerſaries themſelues will not deny this, or if they do, we muſt ſay there is no truth in their words. The whole that his Lordſhips letter can be drawne to make againſt vs, or to teſtifie for them, was in that his honour writing to M. <hi>Blackwell,</hi> wrote vnto him by the name and title of Archprieſt: which alſo hapned (as we thinke) through this occaſion. After father <hi>Parſons</hi> had won the Cardinall to ſolicite and erect a ſubordination in our Church, the like as himſelfe thought fitteſt, he ſent a copie of the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter</hi> to the <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and to others there to reade. Whereupon the <hi>Nuncio</hi> ſeeing maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> to be conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Archprieſt by the Cardinall, gaue him alſo that title. And what is this for proofe of the commiſſion, ſpecially for proofe of the tenour,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16974:47"/> the thing which is to be witneſſed (as is declared before) or elſe what is witneſſed to be little worth?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly touching the teſtimony of D. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> the moſt and all that he wrote to the <hi>Nuncio</hi> concerning the authority of maiſter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> and which our aduerſaries lay hold on for reckord againſt vs, was, that his Holineſſe had made him Archprieſt. Which thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he did neither write by way of affirmance, or to teſtifie ſo much, but onely accidentally by occaſion of another matter, to weete, what he thought fitteſt to be done about maiſter <hi>Tempest.</hi> For at that time the <hi>Nuncio</hi> had ſent M. <hi>Tempeſt</hi> vnto him with his accuſers to be examined in the points, for which the Cardinall Protector had taken away his faculties, while he was in the way downwards from Rome, and giuen likewiſe order to the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> that he ſhould be ſtayed in the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries, and not ſuffered to go into England.</p>
                  <p>Now when Doctor <hi>Worthington</hi> and maiſter <hi>Caeſar Clement</hi> his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, had charged him before Doctor <hi>Stapleto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> with as many things, as they thought good, or as their inſtructions from father <hi>Parſons</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and he had made his anſwer and purgation thereunto: Doctor <hi>Stapleton</hi> aduertiſing the <hi>Nuncio</hi> by letter, how the matter paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, &amp; withall giuing his honor to vnderſtand, what he thought meeteſt to be done in the cauſe, wrote: that maiſter <hi>Tempeſt</hi> might wel be diſmiſſed and ſuffered to depart into England, and as he ſhould there demeane himſelfe, ſo to receiue againe his faculties of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt, whom his Holineſſe had conſtituted ſuperiour in England. By all which, being the whole ſumme of that Doctor <hi>Sapleton</hi> wrote to the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> what more may be gathered, then that Doctor <hi>Worthing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and maiſter <hi>Caeſar Clement,</hi> relating the contents of the <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Letter,</hi> or ſhewing a copie thereof vnto him, which at that very ſeaſon was newly come to <hi>Bruxels,</hi> and made common to many, the other incidently thereupon inſerted in his foreſayd Letter to the <hi>Nuncio</hi> the words aboue mentioned. Which in no ſence can iuſtly be reckened a teſtimony, the writer by euidence of all circumſtances thinking nothing leſſe in vſing the words, then as a witneſſe to teſtifie the commiſſion, or that the ſubordination was the ordinance of his Holineſſe by what he did ſay.</p>
                  <p>But whatſoeuer Doctour <hi>Stapletons</hi> intention was therein, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to witneſſe or not to witneſſe the ſubordination, as it could not be to witneſſe it, vnderſtanding the ſame but by report: yet our aduerſaries themſelues wil not ſay, that the good man did parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:16974:47"/> or teſtifie the tenour of the commiſſion, or any one iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction contained therein. Or had he rehearſed in his letter ſome moe or few particulars of the commiſſion, as he did not, yet we deſire to know, what reaſon or fatisfaction can be yeelded, why he might not as well haue erred in relating the tenour (and conſequently neither bond, nor wiſedome in vs to beleeue his words) as he did in ſaying that M. <hi>Tempest</hi> vpon deſert of his good cariage in England, might haue his faculties reſtored vnto him by the Archprieſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> M. <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> at that time had no authority at all (as himſelfe both confeſſed &amp; practiſed) either to reſtore him, or giue faculties vnto any other vpon what neceſſity ſoeuer.</p>
                  <p>We will not ſtay here to aske the cauſe, why D. <hi>Stapletons</hi> letter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the <hi>Nuncio</hi> vpon the aforeſayd buſineſſe, was brought ouer with other like into England, and here ſhewed for teſtimonies. But although we will not ſtand to demand the reaſon hereof, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but giue all men to know that our ſuſpition, doubts, and miſtruſt of the validity of the new authority, were no whit leſned thereby, but very much increaſed, ſeeing what meane proues were muſtered, and as it were marſhalled in the forefront of the army of prooues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, concerning the teſtimony of M. D. <hi>Barret,</hi> there was yet much leſſe cauſe why he ſhould be brought for witneſſe, vnleſſe the neceſſity be ſuch, that any thing muſt ſerue that can make the leaſt ſhew of ſounding againſt vs, we neuer ſaw or heard but of two letters that he ſhould write, the one to the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>Flaunders</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning matters belonging to Maiſter <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> the other to maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> himſelfe. In either of which, no other teſtimony was giuen, then that he named maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> Archprieſt, and wiſhed that thoſe effects might follow vppon the authority, which the author in the inſtitution of the authority inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, without naming who he was. And what we pray could this poſſibly make to the proofe of that which was then in queſtion, and which we ſtood vppon to know after an aſſured and requiſite manner, viz. whether the Cardinall receiued a commaundement from his Holineſſe to erect ſuch a ſubordination with like iuriſdiction in all points ouer vs. Well, it muſt needes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a rich wardrope, and good proues no doubt to lye in ſtore, where ſuch poore ſtuffe is brought forth for ſhew.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, touching the teſtimony of father <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> (of whoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our impugners ſeeme not to make the leaſt account) firſt we
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:16974:48"/> ſay that to this day there be very few of our company who euer ſaw the letter: and for certaine, neither of theſe two, whom Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> calleth the Princes in the action (and hath ſoreſt puniſhed for defending their owne and their brethrens good names againſt the ſlaunders impoſed) euer caſt eye thereon, or the ſame euer ſent by any or offered vnto them to reade, till after the arriuall of his Holineſſe Breue, and our abſolute admittance of the authority. And therefore whatſoeuer teſtimony it caried, it could little condemne or blame thoſe, that knew no more thereof. But what might the contents be of the letter, or to whom was the ſame written, and to what purpoſe?</p>
                  <p>The letter was written to father <hi>Parſons,</hi> in aunſwere of a letter of his, &amp; to do him to vnderſtand, that the two Engliſh Prieſts, of whom he wrote vnto him, were not as then come to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and that his Holineſſe was much incenſed vpon newes of their intention of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and determined to impriſon them. Againe, that father <hi>Parſons</hi> needed not to come to <hi>Ferrara</hi> about that buſineſſe, in reſpect his Holineſſe intended to make no long ſtay there, &amp; that if in the meane, the two Prieſts hapned to come, he aſſured that their audience ſhould be put off, till his Holineſſe came to Rome.</p>
                  <p>This for ſo much as our memory ſerueth, was the contents of the letter. And now what proofe of the tenour or any particular of the commiſſion is there named in all this, no word, or ſillable ſo much as pointing thereunto? Neuertheleſſe we will not gainſay if father <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> wrote ſuch a letter, but that the diſpleaſure which his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is ſayd to take for their comming (if ſo the cauſe of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was their comming and not rather wrong and ſiniſter informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) may in ſome ſort not amiſſe argue that his Holineſſe was priuie to the erecting of the ſubordination, but it can no way argue that this or this was the tenour of the commiſſion, or theſe the particulars of the iuriſdiction giuen. A point much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to be teſtified, then the commiſſion in generall, ere any be bound to render their particular obedience. For being in poſſeſſion of our particular freedomes, no reaſon to render them vp by conſtraint (as euery bond bringeth a conſtraint) into the hands of another, before he hath ſufficiently and according to law in that matter proued his right thereunto, as was ſhewed at large in the eleuenth Propoſition. And the ſame appeareth alſo plaine by this place in the Decretals: <hi>Antequam exprimantur res,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16974:48"/> delegatus nequit iuriſdictionem exercere.</hi> Before the things be expreſſed<note place="margin">C. 1. Paſtoralis d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And what in this reſpect is true in Delegations, holdeth alſo in commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by word of mouth.</p>
                  <p>We omit to lay downe the reaſons we had of not giuing ouer light credit to what was auerred in the Letter, if ſo it had bene ſhewed vnto vs before the comming ouer of his Holineſſe Breue, and our accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the authoritie. The ſtile ſauoured little or nothing at all of the temper and mildneſſe wherewith the good religious father was knowne to abound: Then the Letter was taken not to be of his hand writing: and ſithence it hath bene acknowledged that it was but a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, and not the originall it ſelfe. Againe the contents greatly deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the natiue and ſweete diſpoſition of his Holineſſe, as in like meaſure and without knowing the cauſe, to be offended with any, for repairing vnto him, and much leſſe with Prieſtes comming from a Realme ſo farre off, and ſo well deſeruing of holy Church, and in the generall cauſe of many. Laſtly the Letter paſſed through the hands of father <hi>Parſons,</hi> and ſome other vnto vs, whom we accounted of no ſuch integritie, but that circumſtances conſidered, we might in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome miſtruſt leaſt ſomething therein might be added or altered, for making the famous Clarke to ſpeake harder againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly touching the teſtimonie of Doctour <hi>Worthington:</hi> none of vs know, or were euer told to this day, what he either ſaid or wrote in witneſſe of the authoritie or tenour thereof, or in commendation of our delay. Neuertheleſſe let his record be what it can be, we hope by Gods grace (when one opponents or himſelfe ſhall acquaint vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with) to be able ſo to anſwere it, as that it ſhall neither conuict vs of the crimes obiected, nor of any other faultie tranſgreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly concerning the teſtmonie of our two brethren the negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the affaire: we maruel why either <note n="*" place="margin">The 14. of March, 1600.</note> our Archprieſt in his twelue propoſed queſtions, or <note n="*" place="margin">The laſt of Iune 1601.</note> father <hi>Holtby</hi> in his diſcourſe, ſhould ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly obiect their ioynt teſtimonie againſt vs, when the firſt Letter of all that we receiued from M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> came to our hands toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Breue, at which time we preſently yeelded our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
                  <p>We do not deny but that M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> in his Letter of the 22. of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary 1599. according to the Romane account, which was deliuered vnto vs ſome ſeuenteene or eighteene dayes before the receit of the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16974:49"/> Breue, made mention that M. <hi>Charnocke</hi> had written vnto vs at the ſame time, but we did not receiue his Lettter, before the comming of the Breue, as our Archprieſt, father <hi>Garnet</hi> and ſome other can witnes, if they pleaſe to remember themſelues. So that what teſtimonie ſoeuer M <hi>Charnock</hi> gaue in the ſaid Letter, it maketh little againſt vs, becauſe we abſolutely admitted the ſubordination, and ſubiected our ſelues ſo ſoone as euer we ſaw his Holines Breue, before the reading of M. <hi>Charnockes</hi> Letter, as the Gentleman can teſtifie who firſt brought vs the copie of the Breue teſtified with the hands of our two brethren in <hi>Rome,</hi> M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> and M. <hi>Charnoke</hi> to be a true copie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it vnqueſtionably followeth, that the breach of promiſe wherewith father <hi>Holtby</hi> chargeth vs for not ſubmitting our ſelues vpon certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate receiued from our two brethren, is an vntruth, as there be many moe in that Letter-treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe notwithſtanding, let vs heare what were the letters and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements of our 2. hrethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by mean wherof they are brought for witneſſes, or as a confirmation of blame againſt vs. They both wrote that they heard Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> affirme, that what was done touching the Archprieſt, was done by order from his Holines: &amp; that they heard ſo much alſo by others, not expreſſing the parties names of whom they did heare it. Againe that they repented themſelues of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the iourney, chiefly of the inconſideration they committed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and that they requeſted their humble commendation and dutie might be done vnto our and their Superiour the Archprieſt.</p>
                  <p>Loe the auowances and writings of them both, and which M. <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> ſignified in a Poſtſcript onely, vpon occaſion by like, that father <hi>Parſons</hi> reading his Letter (as he did, and preſcribed or approued the points to be treated of, in all the letters that either of them wrote vnto vs, during the whole time of their impriſonment, which was full foure moneths) and finding that principall Verbe (the former ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification) miſſing, he would not, but needes haue the ſaid comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments added in a poſcript.</p>
                  <p>Certes that they repented themſelues of taking the iourney, being kept before the writing of the Letters eight weekes (from the 29. of of December till the 22. of February, in cloſe and ſtraight durance, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the iay lourſhip of father <hi>Parſons</hi> their chiefe aduerſarie and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was no ſtrange newes, and leſſe ſtrange that they ſorrowed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration they commited, which as themſelues haue ſithence expounded, they principally meant in not taking the names of moe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16974:49"/> Prieſts with them, or in a better forme then they did, and ſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they omitted the procuring of the King of <hi>France</hi> his Letter in their behalfe to his Ambaſſadour in <hi>Rome,</hi> which was promiſed, and another to his Holineſſe himſelfe for requeſt of fauourable audience in their ſute: matter of iuſt ſorrow, they ſmarting after the rate they did for omitting of the helpes, vpon confidence only of the moſt behoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and reaſonable petitions they were to propoſe.</p>
                  <p>But of what perſons, beſide the Cardinall his Grace did our two brethren remaining cloſe priſoners, heare that the Archpresbyter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the faculties adioyned, was the order of his Holineſſe? Had any of thoſe acceſſe vnto the priſoners, which liued neare about his Holineſſe, or were often in his preſence, and ſo by likelihood might heare when the commiſſion was giuen, or after talked of? Were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtraungers or their countrey-men in the city allowed to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them? Were the ſtudents of the Colledge licenſed at that time to viſite the priſoners, and haue communication with them?</p>
                  <p>No, no, they were alike ſtraightly kept, as they were not ſuffered to conſult or ſpeake with any, nor the one of them with the other. What then? did his Holineſſe Fiſcall (who was appointed to examine the priſoners, but not long after ſurrendred the office to father <hi>Parſons</hi>) report ſo much vnto them? It cannot be ſayd, becauſe the ſame man at the end of all their examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; reſiftings, told the priſoners (as they both witneſſe) that the ſubordination was not the ordinance of his Holineſſe. Of whom then had the priſoners that intelligence? vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly either from father <hi>Parſons</hi> or father <hi>Owen,</hi> who onely had recourſe vnto them: relators that muſt needes haue beliefe giuen to their words, becauſe the one was a chiefe deuiſer of the authority, and his reputation lay in gage to haue it go forward: the other, a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſcholler in father <hi>Porſons</hi> ſtudies, and his right hand in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, as the ſeruice following declareth.</p>
                  <p>When maiſter <hi>Charnocke</hi> wrote his letter vnto vs, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Cardinals for a finall end of their durance, as father <hi>Owen</hi> reported, and father <hi>Parſons</hi> had the peruſing thereof a night and a day, it was brought againe vnto him by father <hi>Owen,</hi> with order from father <hi>Parſons</hi> to adde that the ſubordination erected was the order of his Holineſſe, who anſwering he could not write ſo, becauſe he knew it not, the other replied, that the Cardinall protector ſayd it when he ſate in iudgement in the cauſe, and that father <hi>Parſons</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſame, and therefore he might well and truly write, that to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16974:50"/> his knowledge the Archpresbiterſhip was the appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. Whereupon the priſoner being willing to giue the fathers the moſt contentment he could, for his ſpeedier riddance out of priſon, promiſed him to write in ſo large a maner in that point as poſſibly he could with any truth, and accordingly ſignified in his Letter, yet not that he knew the ſubordination to be the order of his Holineſſe, but that he heard the Cardinal to affirme it, and alſo vnderſtood it by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible relation of others. The like wrote M. <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and not vnlike vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame perſwaſion.</p>
                  <p>But neither the one nor the other of our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor the Cardinall Protector in the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter,</hi> nor any other, of whom witneſſe is claimed, did euer in the leaſt word affirme that the faculties and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction annexed to the Archpresbiterſhip, (the onely point which was moſt needfull of all other to be deſcended vnto, being the moſt materiall, and which alone for the ampleneſſe, rigour, &amp; vnuſualneſſe thereof, cauſed our delay) were the ordinance or commandement of his Holines. A thing worthieſt of ſpecial note, as that moſt manifeſteth the headie violence of our aduerſaries, and how beyond all colour of reaſon, they haue proceeded in their accuſations and outcries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs.</p>
                  <p>Now touching the commendation and dutie our two brethren ſent to be done, to our and their ſuperiour the Archprieſt: who could thinke, reading the paſſage, but that ſomwhat lay hid, &amp; was inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the words, that they being priſoners in Rome, ſhould as it were, hunt after ſo impertinent an occaſion of calling M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, and direct commendations vnto him by that title, when as we were right ſure, they both well knew that the Cardinals Letter made him but Superiour ouer the Prieſtes reſiding in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> only, and not ouer any, whiles they liued any other where. And one of them being ſithence asked the meaning of the ſaid words, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the authoritie of the Archprieſt, not ſtretching to any out of <hi>England,</hi> this clauſe [<hi>so farre as I can ſo farre diſtant</hi>] vſed in the ſame ſentence where he rendred his dutie, did ſhew that he wrote it onely to make faire weather with father <hi>Parſons,</hi> and the ſooner to get himſelfe releaſed of the impriſonment he indured.</p>
                  <p>But would our aduerſaries indeed vnderſtand the truth, how much or wherein our two brethren do either beare witneſſe againſt vs, or condemne our ſtanding off, to yeeld our obedience vntill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of his Holineſſe Breue? Let them reade M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> his anſwere to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16974:50"/> father <hi>Parſons</hi> Letter, and the cenſure vpon the ſame, both printed in the Engliſh booke, and written when they were not in hold, and then tell vs the particularities wherein they giue teſtimonie againſt vs, or find fault with our delay. In the meane, there are none but muſt ſee that all the teſtimonies which are brought againſt vs, proceeded from one head, &amp; take their whole force from the Cardinals word, and not from his Graces word as auowing the particular faculties &amp; iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on annexed to the Archpresbyterſhip to be the command or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Holineſſe, but from his Graces word onely that he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a Commiſſion to make peace in our Country, and that following the will of his Holineſſe he decreed a ſubordination. We therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not bound to beleeue (ſpecially to obey, as hath bene ſufficiently proued before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Cardinals word, himſelfe writing and affirming it, we were leſſe bound by al conſequence to beleeue and obey the ſame related or witneſſed vnto vs by others.</p>
                  <p>And here I thinke good to aduertiſe, touching the report I haue made of all the precedent teſtimonies, that I do not ſo a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>That which I haue ſaid is the whole truth of my owne thoughts, and as much, and not otherwiſe then my memorie vpon beſt recalling of matter could ſuggeſt. If our aduerſaries will haue the foreſaid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſpeake more for them, or in another tune againſt vs: let them produce their Letters, and out of them all, inforce the moſt they can againſt vs. The qualitie and maner of their dealing with vs hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to doth not put vs in hope, they will much ſpare vs: and we on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſide, haue as little feare (truth and ſinceritie encouraging) but that we ſhall be wel able to free our ſelues of as much, as all corners being ſought, can be obiected in our rebuke.

                  <p>On the other ſide, if our aduerſaries ſhall ſay, that the aboue named witneſſes or any of them did reade the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wrote as they did: we aske them what maner of ground this is, &amp; wherein it differeth from the kind of teſtimonie that followeth? <hi>Iohn</hi> imagineth that <hi>Peter</hi> gaue him a boxe on the eare, and thereupon fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a bill of complaint againſt <hi>Peter:</hi> and when he had framed it, ſheweth the ſame to ſundry of his friends.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16974:52"/> 
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> the blow.

But the leaſt cards muſt be all coat-cardes againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>For concluſion of our anſwer to this ſecond obiection, and for a briefe recitall of that hath bene ſaid before in this third reaſon, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech our impugners to conſider vnprightly and ſeriouſly, as before God in the court of their owne vnderſtanding: firſt, whether truth, reaſon, demonſtratiue practiſe, and the voice of all lawes ſpeake not more for vs then for them: nay whether they all do not combine and pleade wholly for vs, and altogether againſt them: namely that euery delegation muſt be proued by ſhewing of the Commiſſion or authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke copie thereof, and not by witneſſes, eſpecially if the delegation or verball commiſſion ſhall impart a many of particular iuriſdictions, as this of his Holineſſe did to the Cardinall with like number of facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Then whether teſtimonies not founded vpon euidence of the eye or eare, but grounded onely vpon report or heareſay, are of any force, or make a preſumption in law, in a matter lately done.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whether it be enough in law or conſcience, when a dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or verbal commiſſion is granted to one, deriuing many diſtinct and ſeuerall iuriſdictions, each bringing their porper and increaſing preiudice to others, whether it be enough we ſay to teſtifie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in generall, and not for the witneſſes to deſcend to the teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the particular tenour of the commiſſion. And if in all theſe three vnderſtanding be conuinced by the euidence and proues aforegoing, then we inſtantly pray them for the loue of their owne ſoules, not to be aſhamed to confeſſe the truth, and ſurceaſſe further contention, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring what the holy Ghoſt writeth: <hi>Eſt confuſio adducens peccatum, &amp; eſt confuſio adducens gratiam &amp; gloriam:</hi> there is a confuſion that bringeth ſin, and there is a confuſion that bringeth grace and glorie.</p>

               <div type="section">
                  <p>A Third reaſon that our impugners make againſt vs, and ſeeme in the force thereof to take no ſmall contentment, is, that at our firſt comming ouer, we were, and are ſtill beleeued to be Prieſts vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon our word, without ſhewing our letters of orders, and that folke come to vs, without making queſtion either of our Prieſthood, or of our iuriſdiction to heare confeſſions: and how then? our ſelues being in this ſort beleeued vpon credit of our owne word, could we refuſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:16974:52"/> to beleeue our Cardinall Protector, vpon euidence of his Graces let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hand, and ſeale? Do we looke that others euen in that tribunall of looſing from ſinne, ſhould rely vpon, and truſt our bare word, and vſe vs without ſcruple in the court of their ſoule, and we in the ſenſible feeling and continuance of this ſupreme credence and fauour, ſo to forget our ſelues and our duty, as not to giue beleefe to the word of a Cardinall, of our Protector, of his Holineſſe Counſellor in all matters incident to the gouernement of the Vniuerſall Church?

                  <p>Firſt we deſire to know of what kind of fault did this our reproued demeanor condemne vs? Not of the crime which was firſt obiected.

Surely of the like offence by coherence (the argument being brought <hi>à ſimili,</hi> of likeneſſe betweene matters) as thoſe ſhould commit, who ſhould refuſe to beleeue vs to be Prieſts vpon our word, and would not but vpon ſurer proofe, vſe vs in that function.</p>
                  <p>Now then what kind of offence might this be? To heare Maſſe, is by the ſtraight condition of our lawes, the forfeiture of an hundreth markes: to helpe a Prieſt at Maſſe, or to be confeſſed of him, is made an act of felony: to relieue, abet, harbour, or maintaine him, no leſſe, What fault then not to beleeue ſuch or ſuch an one to be a Prieſt, or not to partake with him in Prieſtly functions, except he know him to be a Prieſt by other prooues, then vpon the bare reckord of his owne word? Verily the faulte is ſo little, as none of iudgement will take it, but for an act of prudence: and the contrary, for a faile of due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, if not for a fact of too much aduenturouſneſſe or te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritie.</p>
                  <p>And our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience here prompteth that our fault-finders, as full of exceptions as they are againſt vs, ne haue, ne will, entertaine any one as Prieſt, and leſſe ſubiect themſelues in confeſſion vnto him, of whom they ſhall haue no further ſurety what he is, a ſpie, or an honeſt man, then the parties bare affirmation of himſelfe.</p>

                  <p>Good conſequences: whether the antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts be true or no. What, muſt the fauour we receiue of the laity in not examining whether we be Prieſts or haue faculties or no, bring an obligation vpon vs to obey our Cardinall Protectour vpon teſtimony of his owne word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and not onely in things of direct and greateſt preiudice, but euen in things wherein the lawes of holy Church giue vs leaue not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey?

Surely ſuch fauours are leſſe worth then thankes, and ſuch ſolide arguments or fond deductions, fitter to be vſed in a matter of ſport, then for condemnation of Catholike Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>To beleeue one to be a Prieſt vppon the affirmance of his owne word, or becauſe he ſaith ſo, is no matter of preiudice to the beleeuer, or to any third perſon: for neither is the beleeuer or any other brought thereby within compaſſe of an enforced ſuperioritie, or of hauing their former liberty abridged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and penalties impoſed at the arbitrarie diſpoſition of their hard friends: but in our caſe, and ſuppoſed obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, it fareth much otherwiſe, becauſe the preiudices that attend the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter,</hi> are many, and of mightieſt preiudice, as hath bene declared in the beginning of this reaſon.

                  <p>And if this had bene their dutie, as the lots changed, it would ſoone haue bene proclaimed, then what thankes did we deſerue in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them that labour and charges, and vndertaking to our great coſt, the diſcharge of that buſineſſe for them?

                  <p>Firſt let vs admit that theſe men write a truth, as how farre their wordes ſwarue from all truth, it commeth after to be examined, yet we are to demaund of them and the reſt of our impugners (who think the fewnes of our number, matter &amp; euidence cleere enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs by) whether the cauſe we ſtand in be naught in that we are but fiue, ten, or twelue which defend it.

                  <p>For further ſatifaction in this point, we refer our aduerſaries to the dayly iudgement, which experience maketh the ſureſt confutation of all other; whether the ſmall number of open defendants (eſpecially when the ſword of authoritie is drawne againſt the matter or action defended, as it is in our caſe) be a ſufficient warrantie in conſcience, for any one of vnderſtanding to infer that the cauſe they ſtand in, is wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked or vngodly, or not meete for men of quiet natures, or Prieſts to be ſeen in. Verily the queſtion is ſo cleare and demonſtrated by dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as he that ſhould make doubt hereof, might not amiſſe ſeem to haue liued out of the world, nothing being more frequent in the world, then for truth to find feweſt defenders, when authoritie, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fauour, and temporall gaine be her impugners.</p>
                  <p>But to vnderprop this weake reaſon, founded vpon our ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, father <hi>Holthy</hi> fortifieth and gildeth the matter in this wiſe. <hi>It is</hi>

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16974:57"/> and from a proud preſumptuous mind and ſeditious ſpirite.</hi> Alſo, <hi>it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that ſome of the beſt among them, were euer noted for buſie and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirites, yea no one of their chiefeſt almoſt, but he was noted with ſome particular fault or exception: but among their brethren</hi> (who embraced their authoritie) <hi>there were many which liued without touch of diſcredite, and euery way better qualified then any of them.</hi> Thus much father <hi>Holt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</hi> And father <hi>Parſons</hi> in the Apologie ſtriketh this key oft, as the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke perhaps that beſt contenteth his eare: yet becauſe the vntruthes in that booke be innumerable, and becauſe another intendeth to diſplay them in part, we meane not here to inſert any of his courſe reports, but will returne to father <hi>Holtby,</hi> and demaund of him the reaſon, why, if the ill habites and ſinnes he vpbraideth vs with be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, he did not name the perſons he meant, but vſeth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauing wordes in ſuch generall manner, as the Reader is left (a condemned <note n="e" place="margin">Nauar. in Man. ca. 18. nu. 18.</note> kind of detraction) to apply them to whom, and to ſo manie as he liſteth of our companie. Or if the wicked qualities and enormities he obiecteth, be not commonly knowne to raigne in vs, why did the religious father (he and his complices being the <note n="f" place="margin">Sotus de inſt. h. 5. q. 7. art. 3.

                  <p>We expect his anſwere, and how he will cleare himſelfe of both, either being a foule tranſgreſſion: and in the meane do hold this poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that truth out of what mouth ſoeuet it commeth, ought to be <note n="g" place="margin">Gloſſ. in ca. quaeritur 2. q. 7. verb. praeponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</note> preferred and not impugned.

So that how exorbitant ſoeuer our naturall inclination and qualities be, and with what particular faultes or exceptions neuer ſo greatly diſtaining, the chiefeſt of our company go marked, yet if we maintaine a truth, the maintenance is not to be calumniated, either in that we are but few, or becauſe we are (admitting the relgious mans ſlaunders) <hi>buſie headed, proud, and preſumptuouſly minded, ſeditiouſly ſpirited, and wel knowne to be euer noted with particular faultes or exceptions.</hi> In which treatiſe alſo, the ſame diſcrupulous father forbeareth not to condemne

                  <p>Now for the compariſon, we are very ſure that not all nor the moſt part in our Realme, do thinke that M. Doctor <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> M.

                  <p>And concerning the report that he and others make, and ſeeme to glory much therein, that we were but ten or 12. at moſt, who ſtood off, to admit the authoritie, we ſay no more but that fath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Parſons</hi> (through whoſe irreligious dealing our two brethren were ſpoiled of their notes and ſchedules they carried, and which he ſent afterwards into England or the moſt part of them) can witneſſe that there were thrice ten within one who gaue their names: whereof ſome alſo wrote that there were many moe of their brethren, which diſliked the forme of the gouernement appointed, or rather that they were but few, which were willing to receiue it, if they might any way chuſe. And indeede what one commoditie ſpirituall or temporall, either to Prieſt or lay perſon did the authority bring with it, to inuite any one of iudgement<note place="margin">Aggredi.

                  <p>But howſoeuer our aduerſaries do pleaſe themſelues in our ſmall number, yet there are few in our Realme of any acquaintance with
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16974:58"/> Prieſts, but know there be mo then ten inwardly for vs, for one againſt vs. We wiſh from our hearts that euery Prieſt would ſhew himſelfe outwardly, as he is affected in his thoughts, and then we ſhould little doubt but that our ſmall number (ſo great a beame of the eye of our cauſe) would quickly waxe the greater part, and the reckning that our aduerſaries make of twentie for one, to be on their ſide againſt vs, would farre fall out to be truer in the count for vs.</p>

                  <p>The words he vſeth in the dimiſſorie and refutory letters, are theſe: <hi>Manifeſtum eſt quod ipſorum progreſſus etiam ante Breue Apoſtolicum in grauem condemnationem Romae duorum Ill<hi rend="sup">morum</hi> Cardinalium, &amp; etiam ſuae S<hi rend="sup">tis</hi> iudicio prolapſi fuerint.</hi> It is manifeſt that their proceedings (he meaneth our delay and ſending to Rome) euen before the comming of the Apoſtolicall Breue were ſharply condemned at Rome by the ſentence of two moſt illuſtrious Cardinals, and alſo by the iudgement of his Holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Were not our deſeruings very ill if theſe things be true?

                  <p>Moreouer, if condemnation paſſed vpon vs at Rome, as complices of our two brethren, then doth it neceſſarily follow, that we were their complices in the crime they were condemned for. And what crime was that? for maintaining controuerſies as the ſentence expreſſeth, with other men of their order. Well, but what kind of controuerſie did they maintaine? and with what men by name? and how came our partaking with them ſo notorious, as that we might rightfully be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned (for what was not rightfully done, can neuer be but iniuriouſly obiected) without ſummons or relation from vs, what we could ſay for our ſelues?

Wherefore it were well, and but the due tribute of charitie (conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the infamie that groweth vnto vs by ſo publike an affirmance of our condemnation at Rome) that declaration were made both what the controuerſies were in particular. &amp; the names of the perſons with whom they were maintained, and alſo our notorious participation in the ſame that ſo our countrey might be informed of the particular: and our ſelues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16974:61"/> ſuch helpe, we cannot hitherto call to mind.</p>
                  <p>To ſay that the controuerſies, and the perſons with whom they were maintained, was the delay which our two brethren &amp; our ſelues made in admitting the new authoritie after ſight of the Cardinal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector his Letter: and in their going to Rome by our perſwaſion, for more certaine knowledge of the ſubordination, and how fully it was eſtabliſhed, and for informing his Holineſſe, aſwell of the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences thereof, as of the needs that abound in our country, were, as we thinke, to charge the two Cardinals with ignorance or error, or both. For if this were the controuerſie, and the Archprieſt the partie with whom it was maintained (as if not, the whole world ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not proue vs to be their complices in any other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſie) then we muſt ask this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: whether M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> was at that time, when we delayed to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect our ſelues vnto him ſo authorized our Archprieſt, as we were bound vnder ſin or other bond to admit him before the comming of his Holines. Breue If he were not, as the foregoings ſhew he was not, and the enſuings God willing ſhall proue that we could not admit him without tranſgreſſing the lawes of holy Church, then the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admittance of him was not to maintaine controuerſies, but to defend, we ſay not our freedome (though if it had bene ſo, the endeuour had beene moſt lawfull and honeſt) but to defend trueth, to ſhunne penalties, and for conſeruing order and the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of Gods Church inuiolated. Actions which no way approach to that degree of deformitie, as to deſerue exile and alſo confinement in exile, and in Catholicke Prieſtes, that had many yeares ventered their liues in Chriſt his cauſe, and the baniſhment and confining therein to be inflicted vpon them by perſonages of Eccleſiaſticall preeminence.</p>
                  <p>If on the other ſide, M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> was ſo fully and abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted our Archprieſt, as we could not without ſinne protract the ſubmiſſion of our obedience vnto him: then muſt we craue pardon to thinke that the two Cardinals miſtooke in their ſentence, <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> one kind of ſinne for another, the leſſe for the greater. For the only and ſole cauſe which their honors alleage in the ſentence of baniſhing and confining our two brethren, was for that <hi>they had maintained controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies with men of their owne order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that if the bearing off to receiue M. <hi>Blackwel</hi> in the authority he claimed, were indeed the maintaining of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies which their graces meant in their ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (as needs it muſt be if M. <hi>Blackwel</hi> wrote
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16974:61"/> a truth in affirming vs to be condemned at Rome as their complices, we being at no time their complices in any other controuerſie) then as we haue ſaid, their Graces miſtooke the leſſe ſinne for the greater, controuerſie for diſobedience, or truer for rebellion: <note n="a" place="margin">Panorm. in ca. ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Errours of that nature, as it were hard to thinke their graces would commit, conſidering their long practiſe and place, but chiefly in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the vnuſuall and grieuous puniſhment impoſed, and for that by this generall or improper ſpeech, neither the puniſhed were let to vnderſtand the nature of their offence (a default in iuſtice) nor ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction giuen to the world, why ſo heauy chaſtiſement was taken of Prieſts comming ſo farre off to the Sea of Rome.</p>
                  <p>Conſiderations which force vs to thinke, that their Graces meant not by the ſaid words of the decree, the controuerſie which our two brethren had with the Archprieſt, in not admitting his authoritie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſight of the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter,</hi> but the maintaining of ſome other controuerſie, albeit we wote not, nor can geſſe what controuerſie that ſhould be, or with whom.</p>
                  <p>Againe the wordes of the decree are <hi>for maintaining controuerſies with other men of their owne order.</hi> Which being ſpoken in the plurall number, and none can ſay that either of our two brethren maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned controuerſies, or had ſo much as vnfriendly ſpeech with any one Prieſt (M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> excepted) in reproofe or diſlike of his admitting the ſubordination. Which conuinceth except the ſentence were erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly giue, that their Graces could not not vnderſtand by <hi>maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning controuerſies with other men of their owne order,</hi> the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16974:62"/> the Archprieſt and them concerning the receiuing or not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the Subordination.</p>
                  <p>And to ſhew the aduantages that commonly concurre with all truth, and do abound in this, we will grant to our aduerſaries that the Cardinals vnderſtood no other controuerſie in their ſentence, then that which our two brethren had with our Archprieſt about the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, and wherein we were their complices, and that alſo the puniſhment inflicted, was ſuch as it might aſwell appertaine to vs as to them (as how meerely impoſſible it was ſo to do, it hath bene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before) yet what ſequence can be inferred either in equitie (which is iuſtice tempered with the ſweetneſſe of mercie, and euermore cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth her due place in iudgements giuen by ſuch perſonages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe iuſtice without mercie is crueltie, as S. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> writeth) or in rigour, extending all things to the higheſt ſeueritie that can be?

Or howſoeuer this be, yet his Reuerence may do well to tell vs and the world beſide, being poſſeſſed with his former charge againſt vs, in what words of the Breue either expreſly or implicitiuely in the ſayd condemnation contained of all things done to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie? We ſay done, ſignifying actions that paſſed before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the Breue, as did our deferring, and not actions enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed ſince the publiſhing thereof.

                  <p>If the Cardinals letter was of actuall force to bind from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from whence did it take vigour?

But it hath bene made verie manifeſt before, that the Cardinall could not inſtitute ſuch a forme of gouernement in our countrey by vertue either of his Cardinalſhip, or Protector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and therefore the letter his Grace wrote for enacting the ſame, was by vertue of ſome extraordinarie iuriſdiction, and not by any quality of his foreſayd dignities, and conſequently the iuriſdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extraordinary, we were not bound to giue ſuch infallible credite, and height of obeyſance to his Honours letter, as by and by to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our ſelues to the ſubordination his Grace appointed, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vnprofitable, imperious, and moſt burthenſome, before his Grace had proued the commiſſion by other meanes, then by witneſſe of his owne word.

                  <p>And now to come to the laſt part of the foreſaid auowance, where our Archprieſt writeth, <hi>that our proceedings euen before the comming ouer of the Breue were ſharpely condemned by the ſentence of the two Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Cardinals, and alſo by the iudgement of his Holineſſe.</hi> It hath bene ſhewed that no ſuch condemnation paſſed vpon vs, either by ſentence of the two Cardinals, or by the iudgement of his Holineſſe. And we further affirmed, that what condemnation ſoeuer paſſed vpon our two brethren, by ſentence of the two Cardinals, yet that, that condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſentence cannot truly and properly be called the iudgement of his Holineſſe. For although the ſaid Cardinals tooke their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from his Holines of being iudges in the cauſe of our two brethren, neuertheleſſe the ſentence they gaue was their owne act and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not the act and iudgement of his Holineſſe, as is moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The infere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we would make out of theſe is, that admitting the two Cardinals giuing ſentence vpon our two brethren, had inuolued and condemned vs their complices in the ſame ſentence; as there is no ſuch thing nor by iuſtice could be, yet their Graces giuing that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence as delegatine Iudges, neither did, nor could but make the ſame ſentence their own ſentence, and not the ſentence and iudgement of his Holineſſe, and conſequently we cannot but recken this auowance of our Archprieſt [<hi>that our proceedings yea before the comming of the Breue were very grieuouſly condemned by the iudgement of his Holineſſe</hi>] among the manie of the other wrongs that his Reuerence hath done vs, vnleſſe he ſhall proue the defaming aſſertion otherwiſe, and more ſubſtantially then becauſe the two Cardinals condemned our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to be baniſhed and confined.</p>
                  <p>And to end our anſwer to this fifth obiection brought againſt vs, we do moſt certainly aſſure our ſelues, that if his Holineſſe were made acquainted with the manner and nature of things as they proceeded, he would ſo little giue our Archprieſt and father <hi>Parſons</hi> thankes for making him the prompter or approuer of the ſayd ſentence againſt our two brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he might peraduenture ſharply rebuke their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therein. For who can thinke that his Holineſſe compaſſionable and bounteous nature, would not onely inflict baniſhment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement in baniſhment for an action lawfull, yea, preſcribed by the Eccleſiaſticall Canons, as when <note n="c" place="margin">Ca. Si quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do de reſcript.</note> doubt is made (as ſincerely and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God we had great doubt of the Cardinals authority to inſtitute

Offices, which we performed: for, both we requeſted maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> very earneſtly to forbeare the abſolute aſſuming of the authority, with promiſe notwithſtanding to obey him though we would not fully and perfectly admit the ſubordination, before more certaine knowledge came, that his Holineſſe ſtood priuie and conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to all and euery branch of the ſubordination and iuriſdiction graunted to the Archprieſt: and alſo made him acquainted with our intention of ſending to Rome about our doubts. Yea maiſter <hi>Biſhop,</hi> the Sonday before he &amp; our brother began their iourny, went to him, renewed the petition, gaue him a note vnder his hand and name, of the particulars about which he meant to deale with his Holineſſe, &amp; receiued a counterpane or another like note of maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> (which he caried to Rome with him, and which of likelihood the Fiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or Fa. <hi>Parſ.</hi> rather, tooke from him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the other ſchedules, when at their apprehenſion he bereft them of al the writings they brought) teſtifying that ſuch and ſuch were the matters that he went to Rome for, and to propoſe to his Holines. What more plainer or honeſt dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling could be deſired on our part? Or what ſhould we further adde? Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> himſelfe, in the ſixth of his twelue queſtions which he propoſed to vs to aunſwer vnto, dated the fourteenth of May, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that, <hi>Quòd ante ſuum diſceſſum agnoſcere ſuum Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſbyterum viſi ſunt, &amp; quod illo conſcio, &amp; non contradicente, quamuis improbante, iter arripuerint,</hi> That both our brethren did ſeeme before their departure to acknowledge their Archprieſt, and that they tooke their iourney with his priuity, and not contradicting though not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing.</p>
                  <p>Another materiall euidence of diſprouing that which hath bene obiected againſt vs was, that when our brethren were firſt commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted priſoners, they both took a corporall oath, and one or both prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted<note place="margin">Agnized in the Apologie fol. 130.</note> vnder the ſame as well for themſelues as for vs their aſſociates, that if his Holineſſe thought not meete to incline to our petition for chaunging the ſubordination into ſome more profitable kind of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, but would ratifie or confirme that which was erected, yet that we were content and ready to yeeld all obedience thereunto. We aske here againe, who can thinke that his Holineſſe compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and bounteous nature, would not only enioyne baniſhment, &amp; confine them in baniſhment, for an action of this quality, and veſted
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16974:67"/> with no other circumſtances, but would alſo beſide the nature of the puniſhment, which drew infamie vpon their perſons, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſure to alienate mens mindes and charities from releeuing their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, not ſo much as contribute one peny of maintenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hauing the diſtribution of the fragments that remaine in the twelue baskets,<note place="margin">Luke 9.</note> we meane of all the charities abounding in Gods Church, either to carie them to the places aſſigned being Prieſts, or there to liue by after their comming. We therefore as we haue ſaid, do moſt confidently aſſure our ſelues, that if his Holines ſhould once come to know (as we doubt not but God in time will worke it) the true ſtorie of theſe ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems, that his mature conſideration will giue father <hi>Parſons</hi> and our Archprieſt little thankes, in making and diuulging him to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creer, or director of the iudgement that paſſed vpon our two brethren.</p>

                     <hi>profeſſed to vs &amp; the whole world in his letters patents vnder his hand and publike ſeal, that he inſtituted the ſubordination by ſpecial commandement of his Holineſſe.</hi> Alas, what needed this amplifying of words or vntruths rather? For firſt how can it well be verified that his Grace teſtified and profeſſed ſo much to vs, and the whole world, when he neuer wrote a word of that or of any other matter vnto vs, and addreſſed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutiue Letter by name to M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> onely? Againe, how can it be truly ſaid, that he teſtified and profeſſed it in his Letters patents and vnder his publicke ſeale, when the Conſtitutiue Letter came cloſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, according to the Romane faſhion of ſealing miſſiue Letters with a labell? A particular which I ſeeme very perfectly to remember, and the more perfectly by this token, viz. that when M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the ſaid letter vnto me to reade, he bid me beware of bruſing the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:16974:69"/> ſeale. Which wordes the Letter being foulded vp, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſeale not to be ſeene that was put too in the inſide after the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, made me to vnderſtand them, of the ſeale which I ſaw on the backe of the letter remaining (the labell being cut and the ſeale not touched when the letter was firſt opened) faire in his full print or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traite.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, becauſe our memories may deceiue vs, we will not ſtand vpon it, nor was it alleaged to the end to weaken thereby the validitie of the contents of the Conſtitutiue Letter the force ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<note place="margin">Tholcſanus in Tit. de reſcript. li. 1. ca. 2. nu. 13</note> being one and of equall degree, whether the ſame came patent or cloſe ſealed. Neither was the ſaid Letter euer denied by any, to be the Cardinals Letter, though we al did moſt aſſuredly a certaine our ſelues that you father <hi>Parſons</hi> had the ſole penning thereof, and not of the Letter alone, but of the inſtructions and additions alſo.</p>
                  <p>The only cauſe why we touch theſe, is, leaſt ſome hearing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutiue Letter to be named Letters patents, may thereupon imagine it to be of ſuch irrefragable authoritie as the word ſignifieth in the lawes of our Realme. And perchance not to vnlike purpoſe was that added, which followeth (<hi>vnder his hand and publicke ſeale</hi>) to the end that others reading the wordes, might conceiue the ſeale fixed to the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter</hi> to be the ſeale of ſome publike office, and therfore great rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to diſobey, or except againſt any iot of the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.

                  <p>But the truth of the other aſſertion, to wit [<hi>the Cardinall teſtified and profeſſed to vs and the whole world, that he inſtituted the ſubordination by ſpeciall commaundement of his Holineſſe</hi>] is more doubtfull by much as being vnder the checke and controlment of ſo many, as ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to reade the Conſtitutiue Letter. For in what place thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can ſo much or halfe ſo much be ſhewed, vnleſſe the letter muſt be read with ſpectacles, that haue vertue to make that to appeare to be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therin
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16974:70"/> is not? The Cardinall onely affirmeth, that <hi>his Holineſſe enioyned him by ſpeciall commandement to make peace in our countrie, after the example of the peace and quietneſſe made in the Engliſh Colledge at Rome.</hi> Which commiſſion or authoritie to make peace, is (vnleſſe we be infinitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued) a farre different thing in nature, from the authoritie to inſtitute an Archprieſt, with like ample and exorbitant iuriſdiction in our whole Church. Verily the proportion ſeemeth to be ſo little, and the diſſimilitude between the meanes of making peace, and it, (the quality of the ſubordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the maner of bringing it into our Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) as there could well no hope be conceiued of peace to follow, through the inſtitution of ſuch a ſubordination, except we would make the fathers of the Society our directours, and remaine euermore their obſeruant pupils.</p>
                  <p>If it be replied, that the Cardinall wrote in the Letter Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, <hi>how in decreeing the ſubordination, he followed the will of his Holines:</hi> We anſwere, that to follow the Popes will in doing of a thing, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth much from receiuing of a ſpeciall commaundement of doing the ſame. Neither doth it appeare in the Cardinall his Letter that his grace followed the will of his Holineſſe, in erecting this ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> with the iuriſdiction, faculties, and inſtructions adioyned: nay the contrary ſeemed plaine, in that his Holineſſe willed the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall by ſpeciall commaundement (as his Grace relateth the words in the Conſtitutiue Letter) to labour the effecting and eſtabliſhing of peace in our countrie, which ſtanding, his Holines intention and will could not be, but that ſuch a ſubordination ſhould be ordained amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs, as might moſt auaile to the making and continuing of true peace, and in which principall qualitie, the new ſubordination being moſt defectiue (if not part of the faculties annexed of a quite contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) what inference more direct, then that the Cardinall only follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the will of his Holineſſe in the name of a ſubordiuation, (a point of leſſe moment) and not in the ſubſtance, matter, ſpecialties and forme thereof, points incomparably more important? Which, how vnperfect a manner it is of following his Holineſſe will, we leaue to others to iudge.</p>
                  <p>Finally, where you father <hi>Parſons</hi> do ſay, that his Holineſſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the inſtitution of the ſubordination in <hi>reſpect of the diuiſion and diſſention raiſed in England betweene Prieſtes and Ieſuites, or Priestes and Prieſts,</hi> we are glad to ſee you to correct the defaming errour (though the whole Realme could reprooue you if you did it not) which your
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16974:70"/> ſelfe inſerted, in the Conſtitutiue Letter, making the cauſe of inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſubordination, to be diſſention betweene the Secular Prieſts and the Lay Catholickes. And as we are glad of this, ſo may we not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to note the pollicie, that you, labouring to erect a ſubordination, concealed that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Holines which was true, &amp; which moſt needed reformation, (to wit, great diſſention betweene Ieſuits and ſome ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prieſts) and pretended other vntrue matter, viz. ſtrife among the Secular Prieſts, and debate betweene them and the lay Catholickes, a moſt iniurious calumniation. And when by this cunning fineneſſe of masking matters, you had obtained your deſire, that is, ſuch a forme of gouernement as your ſelues made choice of, neither compriſing your brethren here, as it had bene reaſon it ſhould, being the more potent part of the contenders, but in ſteed of this iuſtice and equality, made you and them in truth the electours of our Archprieſt, and <hi>our Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieſt commanded in matters of waight to ſeeke your iudgement and aduiſe:</hi>

                  <p>Firſt we acknowledge, that ſome of our companie went about (though after, and not with like feruour, as M. <hi>Standiſh</hi> now an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant did, being the firſt motioner of the matter and chiefe proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor) to erect a ſodalitie of ſuch as would giue willingly their word and names to obſerue certaine rules that ſhould be agreed vpon and deemed fit for the good of themſelues, and manie other, during the preſent ſtate of things. The cauſe of this proiect, were certaine hard ſpeeches which ſome indiſcreete perſons (either the too zealous fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of the ſocietie, or ſome of the fathers themſelues, or both gaue forth, againſt the ſecular Prieſts in generall, that they liked not to liue vnder obedience, or to haue other Superiours then the direction of their owne wils. Which report (put away the working of diſeaſed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours) grew chiefly and outwardly of this cauſe, for that many of our brethren in <hi>Wiſbich</hi> refuſed to accept father <hi>Weſton</hi> to their Superior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to accept ſuch orders as he the ſaid father <hi>Weſton</hi> and his partie (wherof many were ſecret Ieſuits, and none ſo ancient either in yeeres or in ſufferance for the cauſe, as were ſundry of the other ſide, and of leſſer talents alſo,) thought fit to appoint. To remoue this exception, and to let the authors of the report to ſee in our deedes, that we were no ſuch worſhippers of our owne wils, nor ſo auerted from the duties of obedience, but that we would in the degree that becommed ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prieſts, both relinquiſh the one, and bind our ſelues to the other, and alſo to giue helpes and prouocation to our nature (dull by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) of going the more forward in vertue, we thought good, if not neceſſarie, to vnite our ſelues and agree vpon ſome certaine rules, and choiſe of a ſuperiour, for the better obſeruing of diſcipline and the ſaid rules.</p>
                  <p>The rules that were ſet down to be obſerued by the ſodality inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, were firſt ſome eighteene (as M. <hi>Standiſh</hi> can record, who taking them to tranſlate, ſhewed them to fa. <hi>Garnet,</hi> &amp; not vnlike, to other of the ſocietie) containing chiefly, matter of increaſing ſociall and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all loue: and this not onely betweene Prieſts that ſhould be of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalitie,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16974:71"/> but betweene them and all Prieſts, as the rules themſelues yet extant in the firſt draught can witnes: namely of ſurniſhing Prieſts at their firſt comming: of releeuing the needes of other, eſpecially of priſoners and perſons fallen into trouble, or decayed for harbouring of Prieſts: of preaching monethly or catechizing weekely: of aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpon any daunger for ſauing or comforting a ſoule in extreme neceſſitie, being requeſted thereunto: of diſliking no one, for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſodalitie: of declining al ſuch occaſions as might breede va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance with others, eſpecially with the fathers of the ſocietie, &amp; if any like cauſe be offered by them, to acquaint the ſuperiour of the ſodali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with it, that he might forthwith, before the matter grew to head, or be knowne to many, conferre with the Superior of the ſocietie for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe, and a charitable end of the difference: of ſpending daily ſome time in meditation, or in reading ſome ſpirituall booke: of conferring about difficult and intricate caſes, and neuer vpon his owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reſolue ſuch, without taking the aduice of other his brethren: of making a generall confeſſion euery halfe yeere, for the halfe yeare paſt, and of other like points.

                  <p>Or howſoeuer their rules exceeded ours in goodnes, or ours theirs in that, and in forwarding a common good, yet it cannot be denied, but that we, who laboured, or rather propoſed the inſtituting of a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, did ſurpaſſe them in this one point, viz. in deſiſting from proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting<note place="margin">M. <hi>Blackwell,</hi> M.

                     </note> our purpoſe, aſſoone as we firſt vnderſtood that ſome two or three of our brethren miſliked our endeuors, holding it for more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to ſurceaſſe that for peace and quietneſſe ſake, which might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion good to our ſelues and others, then by proceeding in a matter we were not bound too, to kindle the ire or emulation of a few. The like, if the greater and better part of the priſoners in <hi>Wiſbich</hi> (for ſo our Archprieſt and father <hi>Parſons</hi> ſtyleth them) had bene pleaſed to haue done, as by no perſwaſion they could be brought vnto: O Lord, what tumults, what broiles, what ſcandall, what infinite detraction had there bene left vncommitted? And it is worth the labour to note, who they were that principally oppoſed themſelues againſt the inſtitution of the ſodalitie, albeit none were to be of that companie, but with their owne liking and intreatie.</p>
                  <p>Doctour <hi>Bauen</hi> the ſenior Aſſiſtant, ſtood ſo ſtifly oppoſite againſt the introduction of the ſodalitie or aſſociation, as he letted not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme when his opinion was asked therein, that if the Pope ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Biſhop in our countrey, during the preſent ſtate of matters, he would be one that ſhould reſiſt, and informe his Holineſſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience and hurt, which the bringing in of ſuch authoritie would worke in our Countrey. And M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> only of all the Prieſts in our contrey, wrote certaine reaſons in diſlike and condemnation of the Sodalitie: to wit, that as by the rules of Phiſick and Philoſophie, it was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16974:72"/> no wiſedom for any, who had a long while kept their health by liuing in ſuch an ayre, or by feeding on ſuch meates after to change the ſame ayre, or alter their cuſtomarie diet: and as it is a dangerous errour in ciuill pollicie to ſeeke to change the forme of gouernement, vnder which they haue enioyed lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g peace &amp; happines: ſo is it folly, or great temeritie, hauing liued ſo many yeares in peace and quietneſſe in our Countrey, as we haue, without any aſſociation, or other ſuperior, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin now to ſet vp new authorities, and bring in innouations. Yea he added further, how vnfit, how vnprofitable, and how preiudicial it was for any one perſon to take vpon him the Eccleſiaſticall gouernement in our Countrey, and that if he liued to the change of Religion, he would deale for deuiding the Biſhopricks into moe Dioceſſes. Which reaſons concluding directly and moſt ſtrongly againſt the new autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, were anon of likelihood either ſoon forgot, or began to appeare of no force when himſelfe was choſen Archprieſt.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, when father <hi>Parſons</hi> laſt trauelled from <hi>Spaine</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſo greatly diſliked the making of a ſuperior in <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d</hi> among the ſecular Prieſts, as he made it the ordinarie ſubiect of his talke du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole iourney, deuiſing moe and new reaſons dayly for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance<note place="margin">Inconſtancie in the Noter of inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy.</note> and proofe of the inconueniences. But after his arriuall in <hi>Rome,</hi> and conference with M. <hi>Standiſh</hi> and father <hi>Baldwine</hi> (whom father <hi>Garnet</hi> had imployed as his agents in the buſineſſe vnto him) he ſoone altered his mind, vnderſtanding of like, by intelligence from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Garnet,</hi> how probable it was, that in ſhort time the Prieſts would agree vpon ſome forme of gouernement, and therfore it imported him with ſpeede to preuent our intentions, leaſt we hapned in the meane, to make choice, of a kind of gouernement and gouernor which would impeach their deſignes, and make way to the diminiſhing of the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation they now carried in our Country, which was and is the ſwaying of all things as themſelues think meete.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it vnlike, the thing being conſtantly auerred by many, but that father <hi>Garnet</hi> ſent father <hi>Parſons</hi> notice of the man whom he ſhould promote, and of the authoritie and particular iuriſdiction which he ſhould procure vnto him ouer vs. Hence came that place of Scripture into father <hi>Parſons</hi> head, together with his analogicall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.<note place="margin">Act. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Creſcente numero diſcipulorum, factum est murmur Graecorum aduerſus Hebraeos, &amp;c. When the multitude of Prieſtes increaſed, and the former ſpirite in many of them decreaſed, there began preſently murmura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and emulation againſt the fathers of the ſociety.</hi> Hence proceeded the

A facultie ſo little ſecond to the authoritie of the higheſt Archbiſhop in the world, that it may be a queſtion, or rather no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether, circumſtances conſidered, it be not greater then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, our own and our benefactors liues depending thereon. Our own liues, for that, put from our acquainted harbour, many of vs vs do not know where next to hide our heads: theirs, in regard that ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moues by authoritie, can hardly, or not hardly be kept ſecret: and growing to be knowne, our patrons that harboured vs of charitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come diſcouered, and by euery baſe and hungry companion that ſhall get knowledge of the matter, may informe her Maieſties Officers, and procure their houſes to be ſearched, and their goods to be ſeazed on, their ſeruants examined, their children rifled, their wiues throwne out of doores, their lands conſiſcated, themſelues committed to priſon, arraigned, conuicted, executed, and their family for euer after vtterly ruined and ouerthrowne.</p>
               <p>And here the oportunitie of the place offereth an occaſion to ſpeak a word or two, in anſwer to that which father <hi>Parſons</hi> obiecteth and inculcateth in his bookes and writings againſt vs, to wit, that we ſhould affirme <hi>that the Pope could not lawfully appoint ſuch a kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination ouer vs:</hi> and likewiſe that <hi>his Holineſſe could not eſſigne vs a Superiour without our priuity and conſent.</hi> Aſſertions which hitherto I
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:16974:81"/> cannot find by the ſearch I haue made, in any bookes of ours: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe we do not deny touching the firſt, but that ſome of vs haue ſaid by way of reaſoning, yet ſtill with reſeruation of our dutie to the Sea Apoſtolicke and his Holineſſe, that we did not conceiue how his Holineſſe could giue authoritie to our Archrieſt to place and diſplace Prieſts liuing of temporall almes in Catholike houſes, ſith by the laws of our Countrie, the entertainers muſt and do venter their liues and all that they are worth in the action: and that the Prieſts alſo, who are ſo remoued, cannot but receiue thereby ſome flaw or blemiſh in their credit, as being reputed vnfit or inſufficient for the place they were remoued from and conſequently much hindred for getting other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in the meane, not vnlike to fall into the hands of the enemy for want of conuenient maintenance or harbour to ſhroude themſelues. And now if this doctrine ſeem vnſound or abſurd, or other then moſt conſcionable, we requeſt father <hi>Parſons</hi> and father <hi>Garnet</hi> (whom we no whit doubt to be the deuiſers of the facultie, for that we cannot thinke that euer ſuch a rigour was of his Holineſſe ſetting downe, or euer fully vnderſtood by him with the truth of all circumſtances) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct vs in the difficultie, and manifeſt the grounds of the contrarie vnto vs, and we promiſe by Gods grace, that their labour ſhall not be loſt, but that they ſhall haue vs forthwith to change our opinion, and to yeeld them thankes for the charitie.</p>
               <p>Concerning the other aſſertion, that we ſhould ſay, <hi>His Holineſſe could not aſſigne vs a Superiour without our priuity and conſent,</hi> we take it to be more then all our aduerſaries can proue that we euer ſpake. And as for the citing of the <note n="g" place="margin">Dist. 61. ca. Nullus inuitis &amp; dist. 63. ca. ſi in plebibus &amp; ca. 1. de electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</note> Canons that permit or authorize the Cleargie to chuſe their Superiour, they were not cited by any of vs to the end to proue that his Holineſſe could not appoint vs a Superiour, without asking our voices, or acquainting vs firſt with the deſſigne, but were only alleaged, to ſhew that it was a cuſtome receiued in holy Church, &amp; not yet diſcontinued euery where, that the Cleargy ſhould haue the chuſing of their owne Superiour, and which being a fauour allowed to many by the Sea Apoſtolicke, and by cenſure of common reaſon, a great furtherance to peace and of electing the fitteſt perſon; we could not thinke if his Holineſſe had bene rightfully informed, but that his paſtorall loue and benignitie would haue graunted vs (ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our liues as we do for the primacy of his ſeate, and oppreſſed with many ſorts of afflictions) the chuſing of our Superiour, or at leaſt not to haue giuen (as the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter</hi> ſpecifieth) the perpetuall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:16974:81"/> of him to the Cardinall Protector, a ſtranger vnto vs, vnacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the difficulties of our countrey, and diſtant by more then a thouſand miles from vs. To this end were the Canons alleaged, as the circumſtances and drift of the places where they are alleaged, do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And therefore we cannot but feare a ſiniſter intention in father <hi>Parſons,</hi> and in our other aduerſaries, that thus adde to and wreſt our wordes to the ſenſe and purpoſe which themſelues like beſt.

                  <p>IN the yeare of our Lord 1600. vpon the third day of May, it was propoſed to the facultie of Diuines of the Vniuerſitie of Paris, that by the letters of a moſt illuſtrious Cardinall, an eccleſiaſticall Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour was conſtituted in a certaine kingdome, with the title and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of an Archprieſt, to haue authoritie and iuriſdiction ouer all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prieſts reſiding in that kingdome. This Cardinall did alſo declare in thoſe his letters, that he did it according to the wil and good liking of the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding many of theſe Prieſts refuſed to ſubſcribe to the authoritie of the ſaid Archprieſt, before he had obtained letters from the Sea Apoſtolicke, containing the tenour of his confirmation, as well becauſe that kind of gouernement was altogether new in Gods Church, and hitherto neuer heard of, that an Archprieſt ſhould haue charge ouer a whole kingdome, and ſuch iuriſdiction ouer euerie Prieſt in that Realme: then alſo for that it ſeemed to them by certaine wordes of the Cardinals letters, that the Archprieſt and his authoritie was graunted by falſe information: then laſtly, becauſe they noted great partialitie in the choiſe of the Archprieſt and of his Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors. Vpon which, and ſome other reaſons, theſe Prieſts ſent meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Pope, for laying open vnto him theſe their difficulties, and therewithall to ſignifie their greateſt readines, as in this matter, ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore in all other to obey his Holineſſe.</p>

                  <p>The Archprieſt and thoſe who are of his ſide, accuſe the other Prieſts of ſchiſme, in that they deferred to obey the Cardinals letters, which moreouer he ſaid were written according to his Holineſſe mind and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>The queſtion then is, whether theſe Prieſts be ſchiſmatickes, and if not, whether they did commit at the leaſt ſome grieuous ſinne?</p>
                  <p>The head &amp; chiefe men of the facultie of diuinitie in Paris, choſen out of the whole companie, aſſembled together in the houſe of their ſeniour Beedle, in the yeare and day aboue written, after full and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſt conſideration had of the matter, gaue this cenſure.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that thoſe Prieſts who vpon the aboue named cauſes deferred to obey, were no ſchiſmatickes.</p>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:16974:84"/> Sea Apoſtolicke, and expreſly contrarie to his Holineſſe Breue, and to the ſentence iudicially giuen by the two Cardinals appointed iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in our cauſe, and to our common peace ſo much wiſhed for by his Holines. And this we inuiolably command to be obſerued vnder the pains afore ſpecified, &amp; greater alſo according to his Holines pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>In this Decree, there occurre many things that ſeeme very ſtrange: namely, that the ſentence of the Vniuerſitie <hi>is preiudiciall to the dignity of the Sea Apoſtolicke, and expreſly contrarie to his Holineſſe Breue.</hi> O Lord Chriſt! O Sir, our Superiour! who are we, or what may our cauſe be, that not to be adiudged renegates from the Sea Apoſtolike, or traitors to God by ſinne, muſt be accounted <hi>a preiudice to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ſea Apoſtolicke?</hi> ſtrange, and ſo ſtrange as it aſtonieth. You ſay, that the ſentence clearing vs of ſchiſme and ſinne, is <hi>expreſly contrarie to his Holineſſe Breue.</hi> We beſeech you to quote the wordes, to ſhew the place: for if it be <hi>expreſly contrarie,</hi> as you ſay, then the contrarietie muſt needes conſiſt in plaine termes, not in deductions or inferences vpon the tenour or purport of the Breue. Or if this much be not to be ſhewed (as al the labor vnder heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can neuer ſhew it, becauſe neither of the two wordes [ſchiſme, or ſinne] is vſed in the Breue, nor we that prolonged the yeelding of our obedience, any where ſpecified in the ſame:) we then pray you to frame the arguments which conclude and infer ſo much. For verily, we for our parts, do not ſee (as is ſaid before <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 109. 110 &amp; 111.</note> in the place where we haue diſcourſed of this very point) how any ſuch infere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding be made. Or if vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding be miſ-led to make ſuch an inference: yet we proteſt that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nceiue how the authorities that contradict the verity of ſuch an inference, &amp; which we haue alleaged <note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 58. &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentibus.</note> before, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſibly be anſwered or colourably ſhifted off. Or were all the Canoniſts deceiued, &amp; their authorities worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet if M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> be ſuch a ſuperiour Prelate, as is contained vnder the wordes of the former Extrauagant, and as his former facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and largeſt iuriſdiction muſt in all reaſon make him: then is it dead ſure, that no ſuch inference can be made, becauſe that cannot be ſchiſme or ſinne, which the Extrauagant decreeth, and commaundeth to be obſerued, vnder the paine of leeſing the fruites of their eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall liuings, that ſhall preſume to tranſgreſſe the precept.</p>
                  <p>And as we cannot conceiue how the cenſure of the Vniuerſitie could <hi>be preiudiciall to the dignitie of the Sea Apoſtololicke, or expreſly contrary to his Holineſſe Breue:</hi> ſo can we leſſe imagine, how the ſame cenſure can be reckened <hi>preiudiciall to our common peace, ſo much wiſhed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16974:84"/> for by his Holineſſe,</hi> vnleſſe our purgation of ſchiſme and ſinne, be ſuch a barre or aduerſe hinderance of peace, as the one cannot ſtand or be effected except the other be repealed. Which lacke of charitie, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it may ſort with the kind of peace, that perhaps ſome of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries affect, whoſe paſſion of ouerweening of themſelues, is ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant, as they can hardly, if at all, count that peace for peace, wherein our diſcredit is not proclaimed: yet we are ſure that the ſtiffe ſeeking of our diſhonour cannot ſort with that <hi>peace which his Holineſſe wiſheth to be among vs.</hi> For this being a charitable peace, &amp; charity <hi>not reioycing</hi>

                     <hi>vpon iniquitie, but reioycing with truth,</hi> the fathers of the Societie, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially our Superior, ſhould rather congratulate that we were acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by publike ſentence of a famous vniuerſitie, in the crimes obiected vpon errour, then by opinionatiue defending their raſh and temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgement, make <hi>nouiſſima peiora prioribus,</hi> their laſt actions worſe<note place="margin">Math. 12.</note> then their firſt againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the other reaſon which our Archprieſt alleageth alſo, as part of the cauſe why he did ſo ſeuerely prohibite the defending of the cenſure of Paris, viz. for that the ſame was <hi>preiudicial to the ſentence iudicially giuen by the two Cardinals appointed iudges in our cauſe:</hi> we know not where to take the firſt exception, the whole and euery word thereof lyeth ſo looſe and open. Father <hi>Parſons</hi> in the Apologie, will<note place="margin">Fol. 133.</note> not haue <hi>the ſaid ſentence giuen ſo much by way of a iudiciall ſentence, as by way of a letter, vnder the two Cardinals their hands and ſeales.</hi> So that if we may beleeue father <hi>Parſons,</hi> the ſentence was not iudicially gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neither were the two Cardinals appointed iudges to decide whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our deferring (for the cauſes rehearſed in the queſtion) to receiue M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> our Superiour vpon view of the Cardinals Letter, were ſchiſme or ſinne, the matter meerely conſidered in it ſelfe, abſtracted from all circumſtances: nor yet were their Graces appointed iudges in the cauſe of any one of our whole companie, ſaue only in the cauſe of M. <hi>Biſhop</hi> and M. <hi>Charnocke,</hi> as the title of the decree, and the decree it ſelfe doth witnes. Againe, their Graces ſentence doth not ſignifie, that they inflicted the puniſhment vpon our ſaid two brethren, for refuſing to ſubſcribe to the new authoritie, or for comming to Rome; becauſe there is no ſuch thing ſet downe: nay the contrarie is expreſſed, in that the cauſes for which they were reſtrained from comming into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or for going into the kingdomes of Scotland and Ireland, were onely (as the words of the decree do teſtifie) <hi>for maintaining controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies with other men of their owne order, and for that it appeared in no caſe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16974:85"/> expedient for the Engliſh cauſe that they ſhould returne into England.</hi> Now to mainetaine controuerſies with other men of their owne order, and to appeare not to be expedient that they ſhould forthwith returne into England, are things different from deferring their obedience to the Archprieſt, and from ſending or going to Rome, for fuller knowledge of his Holineſſe pleaſure, and to lay open our difficulties vnto him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, if the cauſe, in which the two Cardinals were appointed Iudges,<note place="margin">See more of this point <hi>pag. 101. &amp; ſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus.</hi>
                     </note> was the refuſall to ſubſcribe to the authoritie of the Archprieſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the Letters of Cardinall <hi>Caietane,</hi> and for ſending to Rome: then was Cardinall <hi>Caietane</hi> appointed iudge in the cauſe that moſt nearely concerned himſelfe, a thing againſt law, and ſo intollerable in the miniſtring of iuſtice, as his Holineſſe would neuer haue aſſigned him iudge therein, nor the Cardinall for edification ſake, haue vſed the office, eſpecially in deſigning the puniſhment. Or to grant (which is no more ſo, then a foxe is a fearnebuſh) that the two Cardinals had giuen ſentence in the ſame cauſe before, and otherwiſe, then did the vniuerſitie. What then? muſt the cenſure of a renowned vniuerſitie, one of the moſt famous in Chriſtendome, be ſo lightly ſet by, abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, deteſted, and that in a matter of fact, as whoſoeuer ſhall either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend or maintaine it directly or indirectly, in word or writing, muſt, if he be a prieſt, be preſently in the fact it ſelf ſuſpended from diuine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and leeſe his faculties? or if ſuch a delinquent be a lay Catholike, he muſt in like manner be interdicted <hi>ipſo facto?</hi> A rigour, as the like whereof all the Annales and records of all the Prelates actions ſince Chriſts time hitherto, cannot, as we aſſure our ſelues, yeeld one inſtance or neare example.</p>
                  <p>But that, which of all other points in the decree ſeemeth to be moſt out of rule, is the impoſing of ſo heauy penalties for the direct or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect maintenance of the cenſure. <hi>Whether the vniuerſitie gaue the ſame vpon true information or otherwiſe.</hi> This, this appeared ſo ſtrange, as we hardly durſt beleeue our owne eyes, before we read the wordes ouer and ouer gaine: nor ſhould we ſo haue beleeued the ſame, had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree not come forth in the hand writing of our Superior, and vnder his ſeale. For, was it euer heard, that one Prelate, and of no higher calling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an Archprieſt &amp; Protonotary Apoſtolical, being alſo but a Bache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of Diuinity, &amp; neuer reader in the facultie, would not only, ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſure of a whole vniuerſitie, but ſo farfoorth to reiect it, as to bereaue Prieſts of their faculties, to ſuſpend them from the altar, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict the Laitie, man and woman, yong and old, vulgar and noble,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16974:85"/> whoſoeuer ſhall maintaine the ſame ſo much as indirectly, and this, <hi>Whether the information giuen to the vniuerſity were true or falſe.</hi> Was it euer heard, that Prieſts, hauing no other meanes to maintaine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by, then by vſe of their faculties, and liuing euery houre in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death for profeſſion of their faith, ſhould be ſpoiled of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, diſabled to do good to others, put from the altar, robbed of their maintenaunce, debarred from Sacraments, and incurre all theſe ſpirituall puniſhments, for defending the cenſure of a moſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, famous, and Catholike vniuerſitie, in a matter neither decided by any decree of holy Church, nor contrarie to any expreſſe authoritie of holy Scripture? Was it euer heard, that men and women, leeſing all their goods, and two third parts of their lands, onely becauſe they will not go to a contrarie Church, and dayly hazarding their liues and the vtter ruine of their whole poſterity, for profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Romane faith, for receiuing Prieſts, for releeuing their neceſſities, for the glorie of Gods Church, for preſeruation of Religion, for good example to their<note place="margin">The penalties following the cenſure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction.</note> euen chriſten, ſhould be exiled from vſe of all ſacraments, put from being preſent at diuine Seruice, and dying not to be interred in Chriſtian manner, and to be thus diſgraced, maligned, defamed and ſpiritually afflicted for adhering to their friends, approued to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt by long triall, for taking part with their ghoſtly fathers in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, diſcuſſed and determined to be lawfull by publicke cenſure of a renowned vniuerſitie? Was it euer heard, that the like meaſure hath bene met by an Archprieſt to Prieſts, by a Superiour to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, by a father to his children, by a labourer to his brethen coadiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, by one liuing in perſecution, againſt his fellowes in the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and this by the counſell and direction of religious perſons, who muſt not be counted <hi>ſicut caeteri homines,</hi> as the reſt of workemen in the ſame vineyard? O heauen! O earth! are ye not aſtonied, or do ye not cloſe your eyes, from beholding the iniuſtice, the inhumanitie, the vnnaturalneſſe, the oppreſſion, the affliction vnſpeakeable, enough to ſtumble any that are not well ſtaied by grace?</p>
                  <p>But beſides theſe exceptions of our Archprieſt againſt the cenſure, father <hi>Parſons</hi> as one being inured with the trade of deuiſing ſhiftes, deſcendeth in the Apologie to other particulars, and telleth vs that the <hi>ſaid definition of Paris in very deede very little releeueth our caſe, and</hi>

                     <hi>that we might well haue ſpared to print it. but for making a vaine flouriſh with oſtentation of an Academicall ſentence.</hi> And why ſo? Marie becauſe <hi>the information that was giuen to the Doctours, was wrong and defectuous,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16974:86"/> and that there was no man of the Archprieſtes ſide to reply or tell the tale as it ought to be, and tell them how falſe the information was.</hi> Is all this true? then we pray tell vs what man was at Rome, when you laboured and informed the Cardinall and his Holineſſe about inſtituting the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, <hi>to reply or tell them how falſe the information was?</hi> Had not you father <hi>Parſons,</hi> the drawing of the <hi>Conſtitutiue Letter,</hi> the ſetting downe of the inſtructions and additions? The day of iudgement will declare you had, howſoeuer you cloude matters now from the ſight of thoſe that will not ſee light when the Sunne ſhineth. Were there any Prieſtes in England which were to liue vnder the ſubordination that had a part, a voice, or were made priuy to the deſigne, ſaue happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome two or three, of whom father <hi>Garnet</hi> your inciter and aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſtood wholly poſſeſſed, and had the commaunding of their pens, tongues and trauels?</p>
                  <p>You write in ſeuerall places of the Apologie, that both the Laitie<note place="margin">Fol. 98. 99. &amp; 117. &amp; alibi.</note> and Prieſtes deſired by their letters, and expreſly demaunded of his Holineſſe a ſubordination among Prieſts.

For, where doth <hi>the Cardinall cleerely ſet downe in his Letters,</hi> that he receiued an expreſſe commaundement to erect a ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Certes, either your ignorance appeareth groſſe and verie faultie, that would not ouerview the letter before you affirmed out of it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſuch weight: or your audacitie in the affirmance: there being no ſuch commandement. We graunt that the Cardinall in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Letter maketh mention of an expreſſe commaundement receiued from his Holineſſe to make peace in our countrey, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the peace in the Engliſh Colledge, but what is this to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commandement of erecting a ſubordination, eſpecially ſo affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue &amp; burdenous in our whole church?

When the Cardinall came in his Letter to appoint the Subordination, he made this entrance: <hi>For ſo much as ſome men thinke it would not a little auaile to the making of peace, if a ſubordination were conſtituted among the Engliſh Priests, and the reaſons yeelded by the Prieſts themſelues</hi> (which was but M. <hi>Standiſh</hi> onely, ſo farre as yet we know) <hi>for the ſame, were approued by our holy Father: we following the moſt godly and moſt prudent will of his Holineſſe, haue decreed to ordaine a ſubordination.</hi> Where is the expreſſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16974:87"/> commandement you talke of, and which, as you ſay, the Cardinall ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe clearely in his Letter, we meane, an expreſſe commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of inſtituting a ſubordination? Verily we muſt anſwer you with a <hi>Non eſt inuentus,</hi> except you can lend vs a ſpirit to find that which is not. We propounded the queſtion in as full or more large termes then the Cardinall vſed: for his Grace wrote <hi>ſequentes voluntatem, we follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt godly and prudent will of his Holineſſe, haue decreed to ordaine a ſubordination.</hi> And we, in the ſtate of our queſtion wrote, <hi>that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal did alſo declare in his letters vnto vs, that he decreed the ſubordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuxta voluntatem &amp; beneplacitum, according to the will and good liking of his Holineſſe.</hi> So that where the Cardinall ſaid, he did <hi>inſtitute the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination following the will of his Holineſſe,</hi> we added that not onely he did it, <hi>following his will,</hi> but that alſo he did it <hi>according to his Holineſſe good will and pleaſure,</hi> which is ſomewhat more ample, or of greater emphaſis.</p>
                  <p>Your third exception. <hi>We concealed another thing vttered alſo in the Cardinals Letters, to wit, that a ſubordination was demaunded by Prieſts letters to his Holineſſe.</hi> What? did you dreame when you wrote this? for where, we pray, is it <hi>vttered in the Cardinals letters, that Priests in their Letters to his Holineſſe did demaund a Subordination?</hi> Fie, what failings are theſe? muſt we thinke the cauſe you pleade, no better, but that it requireth to be vpholden with ſuch apparant falſities?

Againe, how ſhall we know, that <hi>his Holineſſe allowed of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?</hi> You ſet it ſo downe indeede, in the Cardinals Letter, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it ſo farre, as it is meant by the reaſons touched in M. <hi>Standiſh</hi> his oration to his Holineſſe, a bird (as all men thinke) of your owne hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: but if you vnderſtand by the words, the reaſons that the Prieſts yeelded in their Letters to his Holineſſe, when they demanded a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of him, as the words themſelues muſt needes inferre: then we do not beleeue it, becauſe we cannot thinke, that any of our fellow Prieſts did euer write ſuch letters to his Holineſſe. But let it be true, that <hi>his Holineſſe allowed of the reaſons which the Prieſtes made in their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:16974:88"/> Letters vnto him for a ſubordination:</hi> yet we know, and not onely by his Holineſſe words to ſome of our brethren, but euen by the record of your owne reports, that his Holineſſe yeelding to graunt a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, would not aſſigne the particular ſubordination till he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſignification from the prieſts in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what kind of ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation<note place="margin">An holy pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that thoſe who were to obey and bore the heate and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the day ſhould make choiſe of the ſubordination and ſuperiour.</note> we liked, and beſt agreed with the ſtate of our countrey. And thus hauing his Holineſſe word for warrant, related alſo by your ſelfe to ſome of our companie: had we not good reaſon (we aske the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and all of iudgement) to thinke (we not aduertiſing his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the kind of gouernement we thought fitteſt) that ſurreption was vſed in the information, and conſequently to delay as all lawes permit, the ſubmiſſion of our obedience, vntill the truth and ſtate of matters were better knowne? Vndoubtedly theſe, howſoeuer they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to other, conuinced our vnderſtanding, and bid vs not to feare ſinne, neither to doubt but that his Holineſſe would take in good part, if not thankefully, our ſending vnto him about the premiſſes.</p>

                  <p>Vndoubtedly ſir, to make that this your fourth exception ſhould ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry any weight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is of neceſſity that you firſt proue (and yet it is a thing which you can neuer proue) the ſmall or great number of the refuſers to ſubſcribe, to be of that intrinſecal aliance or eſſence with our fact, as it made the ſame in his owne nature ſinne or no ſinne. For if the nature of our fact in delaying our obedience, and ſending to Rome, were not changed by the ſmall or great number of vs, who in ſuch ſort prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16974:88"/> to receiue the authoritie: what skilleth it, or what difference can it put, the fact conſidered in it ſelfe, (for with that limitation the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie deliuered their cenſure) whether the doers were many or few, one or a thouſand, this being but an accident and a circumſtance, and of no ſuch omnipotencie, as could poſſibly change the nature of the fact in it ſelfe conſidered? Further, if notwithſtanding that which we haue ſaid, the exception muſt ſtill appeare of force (as all that are of iudgement do wel ſee, it cannot) yet the ſame is doubly ſatisfied in our<note place="margin">Pag. 92.</note> anſwere to the fourth obiection of our aduerſaries, to which place for auoiding of vnneceſſarie repetition we referre the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Now that which you adde for explication or better proofe of the exception, bewraieth a worſe conſcience. Your words be theſe: <hi>That not being the twentieth part at the beginning of thoſe that admitted the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, if we haue increaſed our number ſince, it hath bene by as falſe information as this was to the Doctors of Paris, and by perſwading them to the participation of our libertie and freedome from all gouernement, which is a ſore baite for yong men, as all the world knoweth.</hi> Is this your charitable iudgement father, that neither we, nor our brethren had better ends in our actions then you ſpecifie, and which you recken by verdite of the whole world, a <hi>ſore baite for yong men?</hi> But let vs ſee, now you haue paſſed your cenſure ouer vs, how true the ſame is. The cenſure conſiſteth of theſe three points: firſt, that we ſeduced our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren by <hi>falſe information:</hi> then, that we perſwaded them <hi>to the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of our libertie:</hi> thirdly, that <hi>this libertie and freedome from all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, was a ſore baite for yong men, as all the world knoweth.</hi> So that you make the meanes, by which we drue our brethren to our ſide, to be ſleights and leaſings: and our end, why we drew them, no other then to haue them our fellowes in libertie, and in ſuch a libertie <hi>as all the world knowes, to be a ſore temptation to yong men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the firſt, what <hi>falſe information</hi> could this be in particular by which you ſay we beguiled our brethen? were not all our brethren who haue ſince turned for vs, or manifeſted themſelues to be of our mind, both eye and eare witneſſes of all matters as well as our ſelues? were they not euermore lookers on, &amp; priuier to our aduerſaries pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, then any of vs, from whom they were more auerted? Surely if you know what the particular information was, by which we won the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our part, you may do well to ſet the ſame downe: or if in caſe you do not know the information in particular, then we aske you with what conſcience do you ſo confidently auerre it to be falſe? not knowing it
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16974:89"/> what it was? When you ſhall open this much, we doubt not, but that we ſhall be alſo able to giue you and the world ſatisfaction to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie. In the meane, we deny your ſpeeches to be true. But what ſay we? do we deny them to be true, ſith you affirme no more, but <hi>that we increaſed our number by as falſe information, as was the information which we gaue to the vniuerſitie,</hi> and which being true, as we maintaine, and the other information to our brethren, by your owne wordes, <hi>but as falſe,</hi> we are content if this much do pleaſe, to allow the compariſon? Neuertheleſſe the truth is, that the information and motiues which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited ſome of our brethren to manifeſt themſelues, and drew others to amend their former haſtie errour in receiuing ſo fruitleſſe an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, vpon the ſole warrantize of the Cardinals Letter, was times deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phering<note place="margin">The true cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of our numbers.</note> of matters, the loue of truth, the direction of their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, the inward working of their compaſſion, the ſorrow &amp; griefe their hearts felt, by ſeeing how vniuſtly we their brethren were ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and how violently beyond all meaſure, extremities were caried &amp; proſecuted againſt vs: and this vpon no colour or inducement more then becauſe we were few. So that compaſſion of our miſeries, and loue of leſſening the burden by diuiding it among more, were the meanes and information that increaſed our number, and not <hi>the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of our libertie, and the ſore baite therof.</hi> Neither is there ſcarce any one Catholicke or Proteſtant in our countrey, that markes how matters paſſe, but can tell, that we onely, and none but our partie are puniſhed by the Archprieſt.

                  <p>I ſay, that whereas by occaſion of this authority, and by the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation thereof, many grieuous ſcandals and contentions haue growne in the Engliſh Church, and more do grow dayly vpon that occaſion, and wheras it is affirmed by many Prieſts, that this authority

And now alſo after the increaſe of ſo many wrongs, what haue we done? Mary we made ſute to diſpute the caſe with the fathers of the Societie, and refuſed to graunt our ſelues to be ſo deſperately fallen from grace, and the vnitie of Gods Church, as they would needes make the world and our ſelues beleeue that we were. Againe being denied this, we ſent to the vniuerſitie of Paris for their cenſure in the difference. Further, being debarred alſo vnder heauieſt penalty to maintain euen indirectly the ſentence which the vniuerſitie gaue for vs, we appealed, hauing no other refuge, to his Holineſſe, for redreſſe of the oppreſſions. And here loe, was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, progreſſe and qualitie of the diuiſion.</p>
                  <p>Now we muſt demand of you father <hi>Parſons,</hi> that knowes thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly how to aggrauate the matters you take againſt, whether our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and ſending to Rome, and our promiſe to obey M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> in the meane, were like to <hi>make ſo dangerous a diuiſion, &amp;c.</hi> as was the treatiſe of father <hi>Lyſter,</hi> ſpecially approued and praiſed in the rate it was, and highly commended by your ſelfe?

                  <p>For our <hi>tumultuous behauiours, for the reuell we kept in writing, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and perſwading againſt the Popes ordination, for the conuenticles and tumults we made to draw men into faction,</hi> becauſe you barely affirme them without making any proofe, or deſcending to any one inſtance, we will leaue thoſe that know vs and our actions, to iudge of the truth of the accuſations, and to take you for ſuch a one herafter, as the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of your pen deciphereth you to be.

                     <hi>we did not graunt</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that he was ſo indeed:</hi> was not this a high point in a low houſe trow ye, and worthy to be taxed by a religious pen? Could his Graces eſtimation, eſpecially being more then a twelue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth dead before the writing of the words, be diminiſhed with the Catholickes of England thereby, who neuer knew him, nor ſcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard whether there was ſuch a man or no? or was our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of him to be Protector of the Engliſh Colledge at Rome, and our graunting that he was afterwards honoured by the title of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of England, a deniall <hi>that he was ſo indeede?</hi> who would thus infer that had his wits about him? But you go onward, and make another reaſon of our diſcrediting his Grace, becauſe (forſooth) we no plainer acknowledging him to be Protector of England then is ſaid, did adde <hi>that we were not bound to beleeue him in a matter of ſo large a conſequence as the inſtitution of the Archprieſt, without Bull or Breue.</hi> A reaſon much like to the former.

You would be loth to feed all thoſe that haue, and do make this report be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides vs. Did his Holineſſe himſelfe allow the ſchollers appellations from the Cardinal Protector, as reputed partial on the Ieſuits ſide and gaue them other viſitors, namely Cardinall <hi>Sega</hi> and Senior <hi>Moro</hi> at one time; and at another time, Cardinall <hi>Burgheſio</hi> and the ſame Seni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or <hi>Moro?</hi> It is ſtraunge to ſee how fondly you reaſon and leeſe your ſelfe. A fourth reaſon of yours conſiſteth in that we wrote <hi>that his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Letters drew on a generall and extreme perſecution vpon our necks, and conſequently were not to be allowed by vs.</hi> Sir, here we muſt tell you that you clippe our words, and maime or inuert the ſenſe: for theſe are our words in the place you quote: [What reaſon is there that his Graces bare Letters, the contents whereof drew on ſo great and extreme per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution vpon our neckes ſhould be allowed of by vs as a ſufficient proofe of the delegation?] Now marke how you chaunge them. We made them a demaund, and you make them poſitiue, without asking the queſtion. We ſaid, the contents thereof drew on ſo generall and extreme perſecution; pointing by the word [ſo] to the meere puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing iuriſdiction, which the Cardinall gaue to the Archprieſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counterpoiſe of anie commoditie at all, and to the increaſe of our daunger and our Princeſſe disfauour through the inſtitution thereof: and you turne the word [ſo] into [a] which cutteth away the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. And in ſtead of our demaund, whether his Graces bare letters, ſo preiudiciall vnto vs, ought without anie further euidence, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by vs, as a ſufficient proofe of the delegation: you come in with a <hi>conſequently they were not to be allowed by vs,</hi> omitting that addition of ours, <hi>as a ſufficient proofe of the delegation.</hi> And if doubt be made, whether the contents of the Conſtitutiue Letter can be ſaid to drawe on a perſecution, let the Iuriſdiction graunted to the Archprieſt, of remouing vs from the places of our reſidences: of binding vs to ſtand to his deciſion and arbitrement, in the doubts and controuerſies that ſhall ariſe: of preſcribing what he liſteth, and of forcing vs to obey the ſame vnder loſſe of our faculties: Let theſe and other of like qualitie declare, whether the contents of the Cardinals Letter may not beare
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:16974:94"/> the name of mouing a perſecution, when the perſon to whom the like ample authoritie was committed, was promoted to the office, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in the execution thereof, by thoſe that are the chiefeſt and moſt potent parties of the other ſide of the difference: yea, the verie ſetters downe of the ordinances. Verily whatſoeuer others may think in this point, yet we that are the ſufferers, and againſt whom the ſpleene is borne, do feele more aggrieuances, and a heauier weight of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the vſe or abuſe of the iuriſdiction graunted, then we doe by the ſtraite condition of the lawes of our countrey. In briefe, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the premiſes, and for binding vp all to our greater reproch, you ſay, <hi>It is ſufficient to ſhew our paſſionate and diſcompoſed minds, for that, the Cardinall protector now gone to God, hauing bene to all our nation a most deare patrone and father in all occaſions, we</hi> notwithſtanding, <hi>in all ſpeeches and writings do ſpeake euery where very vnkindly and vnreuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of him.</hi> Sir, if we ſhould aske you, what theſe vnreuerent ſpeeches &amp; writings were, the inſtances would be to ſeeke, vnleſſe you deuiſed matter of your own coining Or to let this paſſe, whom ſhould we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, you, or the famous Cardinall <hi>Allen</hi> gone alſo to God? who told <hi>M.

                  <p>Your ſixt and laſt exception: <hi>That no man was preſent in Paris to tell the Doctors how falſely we put downe in the queſtion, that it ſeemed to vs by certaine words of the Cardinals letters, that the Archprieſt his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was graunted by falſe information, and that partialitie was vſed in the choiſe of him, and his aſſiſtants, and that our meſſengers to Rome, were not ſent to lay open our difficulties to his Holineſſe, but rather to contradict and make a broyle in Rome.</hi> Sir, we pray you to tell vs whom you take your

                  <p>Firſt where as his Reuerence affirmeth <hi>that both by the letters of his inſtitution and by the Breue he may correct the vnquiet by eccleſiaſticall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties:</hi> we graunt it to be true. Neuertheleſſe, if he will infer hereby (as he muſt, or elſe what he ſaith is to no purpoſe) that therefore he hath authority to ſuſpend from the Aultar and to interdict, we deny the conſequence. And the words immediatly following in the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals letter do vtterly contradict any ſuch illation, in that they limite and ſpecify, what penalties theſe ſhould be, namely, <hi>ablatione faculta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum vel ſuſpenſione,</hi> either by taking away of faculties, or by ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:16974:102"/> the vſe of them, as it hath bin proued before. Neither is there any one word of ſuſpending from the Aultar, or interdicting, either in the Conſtitutiue Letter, or his Holines Breue.</p>
                  <p>Againe, let the word [<hi>ſuſpending</hi>] be extended, contrarie to the tenor of the Cardinals letter, and the circumſtances of the place, to ſignifie the eccleſiaſticall cenſure of ſuſpending from the practiſe of all diuine functions, as our Archprieſt would enlarge it vnto: yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe how can the cenſure of interdict (which he hath impoſed vpon certaine of our company by name, aſwell as the cenſure of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion) be vnderſtood, to be contained vnder the limits of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, when neither the letters of his inſtitution, nor his Holines Breue do expreſſe, or imply in generall or particular termes any ſuch iuriſdiction, as may be ſeene by euery one who will but reade the ſaid letters and Breue? And here we can but note the indirect or deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing, which is offered in citing places ſo by halfes, for proofe of the things they would prooue againſt vs, as if they did not maime or diuide the ſentence, by leauing out words which immediatlie fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the place, the very ſame authorities which they alleage for proofe of matters againſt vs, would moſt diſproue their owne ſayings. For example: After that our Archprieſt had interdicted ſome nine of vs by name, I wrote vnto him the aforeſaid letter, requeſting his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to aduertiſe (if he would haue vs to obey him therein) by what authority he inflicted the like Cenſures vpon vs, becauſe neither the Conſtitutiue letter, nor the additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s annexed thereunto, did giue him any ſuch kind of iuriſdiction ouer vs: who to proue that he had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to interdict vs, affirmeth that <hi>by the letters of his institution, and alſo by the Breue, he may inquietos poenis coercere eccleſiaſticis, correct the vnquiet with eccleſiaſticall penalties,</hi> leauing forth the words which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatlie followed, and which ſpecified with what eccleſiaſticall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties he ſhould correct, <hi>ablatione nimirum facultatum vel ſuſpenſione,</hi> namely, <hi>by taking away their faculties or ſuſpending.</hi> Which words, and part of the ſentence, if <hi>M. Blackwell</hi> had not left out, the very place he alleaged for proofe of his authoritie, did moſt clearely demonſtrate and conuince the contrarie. Neither is this the firſt time, that ſuch kind of foule play hath bin offered vs: for in the third of the twelue queſtions (which our Archprieſt, or father <hi>Garnet</hi> in his name propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto vs to be anſwered, in ſtead of graunting the diſpute we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,<note place="margin">In ſua eccle. rep. de ſtatu Ill. Cardinal. nu. 9.</note> for ending of the controuerſie) the like pranck is practiſed, the propounder alleaging <hi>Zecchius</hi> to affirme that, againſt vs for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:16974:103"/> them, which if the whole ſentence had bin taken, &amp; not cut off guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the mids, it had made moſt ſtronglie for vs againſt them. <hi>Zec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> words are theſe, <hi>Cardinali creditur testanti ſibi aliquid à Papa viuae vocis oraculo mandatum, vt quod restituat aliquem natalibus, ſi tamen de magno alicuius praeiudicio agatur, ei non creditur.</hi> A Cardinall is to be credited on his word, affirming that he receiued a Mandate from the Pope by word of mouth, namely, that he ſhould make ſuch an one a Gentleman, who was of baſe bloud before: but if the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Cardinall giueth teſtimony, concerne greatly the preiudice of an other, then is his ſole word of no ſufficient power, to bind any to belieue him. Now the propoſer of the twelue queſtions (were he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Garnet,</hi> or <hi>M. Blackwell</hi>) aſſumed only one part of the ſentence, as euery one may ſee, where the difficultie lay not, and which made for them, and omitted the other part, that belonged to the ſtate of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and which made moſt ſtrongly againſt them. But can theſe odde ſhifts and paring of ſentences proclaime other then a bad cauſe, and lacke of ſinceritie in the mainteiners? No, no, the wiſe do note it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, whereas our Superior affirmeth in his letter, <hi>that he was appointed Archprieſt of the Engliſh Catholikes, for the happie rule and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment and mutua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Blackwell</hi> wrote theſe) ſignified <hi>that the Cardinall had by his commaundement for the happie rule and gouernement, and mutuall loue, peace, and vnion, of the Catholikes of the kingdomes of England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and for conſeruing and augmenting eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, deputed M. Blackwell Archprieſt by his Letters patents ouer the Engliſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes:</hi> Yet no ſuch thing appearing in the ſaid Letters, <hi>M.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:16974:103"/> he is no more, nor can be taken for other, then the writ of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ordaineth him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to that <hi>M.

                  <p>Fourthly, touching the authorities, his reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce citeth out of <hi>Zaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rella</hi> and <hi>Zecchius, that an inferior Prelate to a Biſhop, may ordaine penall ſtatutes againſt his ſubiects, and aſſigne the penalties as he will himſelfe: and that a ſingle prelate hauing iuriſdiction, may interdict: and that alſo lower prelates then Biſhops, may preſcribe lawes in a maner epiſcopall to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</hi> We anſwere. Let it be ſo, that a lower prelate then a Biſhop can do theſe things, yet how doth it appeare that himſelf is ſuch a Prelate? I wis whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this is proued, he being but an Archprieſt, we ſhall ſee grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wonders, then euer any Canoniſt read or heard of. For if he can do theſe things by the authority and title of an Archprieſt (as it is moſt ſure by the places alleaged before, and by the vniforme conſent of all writers that he can not:) then theſe and other like particulars, which his Reuerence hath aduentured vpon, being more, and beyond the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:16974:104"/> forme of the Conſtitutiue Letter; it followeth moſt certainely, both, that he could not do them, or if he ſhould do them, yet that they are of no obligation. Firſt that he could not do them, is very cleare, becauſe he could do no more in matters not belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to the office of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presbiter (which are all things requiring iuriſdiction in the exterior court, as it hath bin proued before) then was expreſſed in the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or inſtrument of his authority: And ſecondly that if he ſhould do them, they are of no obligation, is alſo cleare, becauſe whatſoeuer is done without authority <note n="f" place="margin">D. Tho. 1. 2. q. 96. ar. 4. c. &amp; 2. 2. q. 60. ar. 2. &amp; 6.</note> ne doth by law, nor can bind in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience: and therefore I can but maruell what moued his iudgement to write <hi>that my booke may teach me what he may do ex lege communi by right of the generall law, if other ſufficient warrants wanted;</hi> when hauing but a delegatine authority in all matters appertaining to the exterior court, and this alſo in a ſet forme preſcribed vnto him, (which he could not exceede without the vſurping of authority, a <note n="g" place="margin">Idem, ibidem, &amp; Nauar in man. ca. 27. nu. 8.</note> mortall ſinne of his owne nature) would notwithſtanding clayme, or ſeeme to clayme an increaſe of his puniſhing iuriſdiction <hi>ex iure communi,</hi> from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law, ſith the ampleneſſe thereof was particulariſed in the ſame Inſtrument, in which the office and prelature were graunted vnto him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly concerning his <hi>ground in declaring me to be interdicted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out citation before,</hi> I little doubt, but that vnder his leaue, he is greatly miſtaken in the matter.

Our Archprieſt in the letter or inſtrument, in which he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended and interdicted me, and redoubled the taking away of all my faculties, layeth downe three cauſes of ſuch his proceſſe againſt me. Firſt, for that I confeſſed to haue giuen conſent to the prefixing of the reaſons ſet before the Appeale: whereby, the ſame being the breaking of his decrees, I incurred, as he ſaith, the cenſure of ſuſpenſion, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, and the loſſe of all my faculties. Secondly, for that I wrote other Letters not vnlike to thoſe which the Appellants of <hi>Wiſbich</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed. Thirdly, for that I ſent him the Appeale, wherein three of the Appellants, whoſe names were ſubſcribed thereunto, had ſeriouſlie or by other proteſted their vnwittingnes to the ſaid Letters prefixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apeale. Theſe were the cauſes, which our Archprieſt yeelded
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:16974:105"/> for inflicting the abouenamed cenſures and penalties vpon me, as the words of the Inſtrument it ſelfe do ſhew, which follow.</p>

                  <p>Now, that neither of theſe three imputed offences were ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as our Archprieſt by law or conſcience could declare me to be ſuſpended and interdicted, or could ſuſpend, interdict, or reduplicate the taking away of my faculties without citation before, or hearing what I could ſay in the matter, I lay this ground: That a fact be ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious as the eccleſiaſticall iudge may declare the doer to haue fallen into cenſures, or to impoſe cenſures vpon him for the ſame without ſummons, it is not only of neceſſity (as it hath bene aboue prooued out of <hi>Alphonſus Vilagut, Panormitane,</hi> and <hi>Felinus</hi>) that the fact it

<pb n="1000" facs="tcp:16974:110"/> ſinne, and very ſchiſme it ſelfe to be included: and many mo through your authority and perſwaſion, haue commonly holden vs, and do ſtill repute vs as men guilty of the ſaid enormities. Whereupon we cannot but wonderfully admire the too too great ſeueritie of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, both depriuing vs of the reputation of our good names, and bringing burden intollerable for many reſpects vpon vs. For ſeeing we are commaunded, both by Gods law and mans, yea by the very inſtinct of nature it ſelfe, and laſtly by the reaſon of our office, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our fame, and ſo neere as we can to preſerue it from touch or blemiſh; your Reuerence hath expreſſely forbidden vs this duty, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der moſt grieuous eccleſiaſticall penalties and cenſures. And whereas beſide, we tooke our orders of Prieſthood (by which inſtitution of life we fell into the heauy diſpleaſure of our Prince, and are made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of all temporall commodities, and are euery minute in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall danger to looſe our liues) only for the recouery of ſoules, and for propagating the Catholike faith: your Reuerence hath bereaued vs of that ſpeciall thing, which before others, was moſt neceſſary to the attayning of the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the vſe of our faculties, for this only cauſe, that we labored to free our good names from infaming calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niations, as we are bound to do. Whereof it muſt needs follow, that we ſhall in ſhort ſpace be brought to vnſeemely beggery and want of all neceſſaries, and ſoone after, to moſt certaine deſtruction of life. We purpoſely omit here to make any mention of that prohibition of yours, to wit, <hi>that no man goe about to ſeeke or giue any voyces, or make any meetings or aſſemblies.</hi> Which reſtraint is thought to bee ordayned by your Reuerence to this end, that all courſes may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred vs by theſe meanes, both of repelling vniuſt oppreſſions by mutuall connexion of voyces and wils, and likewiſe of appealing to <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire.</p>
                  <p>With the like ſeuerity, your Reuerence in the ſame decree, doth alſo thunder the penaltie of interdiction to be incurred <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the laiety that ſubmit not themſelues to your ſentence or iudgement in this controuerſy. The ſharpnes of which hard dealing, may iuſtly ſeeme to them for this cauſe the more violent, in reſpect that the penalties which they are charged by the lawes of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, become ſo much the heauier and more burdenſome vnto them. For thoſe that are of ability, pay twenty pound a moneth to the Queenes Eſchequer, and thoſe that pay not the former ſumme, forfet all their goods, and two third parts of their lands: and if it can be
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:16974:110"/> prooued that they haue heard Maſſe, they pay one hundred marks. Likewiſe if they receiue any prieſt into their houſe, or otherwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his wants, they looſe all their goods, lands, and life. Which being ſo, they thinke your Reuerence dealeth too ſeuerely and vniuſtly with them, by inflicting this cenſure of Interdict, whereby they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can receiue Sacraments, nor be preſent at diuine Seruice, nor yet be buryed after chriſtian maner, if either they defend the ſentence of the moſt famous Vniuerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> (as appeareth by the Decree of your Reuerence before alleaged) or take vpon them in any ſort to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the good names of their ghoſtly fathers, or any way cleare thoſe from the imputation of ſchiſme, by whoſe good meanes they were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt brought to the obedience of the See Apoſtolike, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the ſame, and do well know by their long conuerſing with them, the ſincere integritie of their liues.

                  <p>You alſo affirme, <hi>that you tooke a great diſlike at the laſt time you tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with me, by reaſon of certaine words I then vſed of ſpite and reuenge againſt a religious perſon, that beholding as in a glaſſe ſuch imperfections in a man of my ſort, it hath made you euer ſince the more heedfull to ſhunne the fault.</hi> Sir, I am glad that my frailties are ſteps to your vpriſing in vertue. But touching the truth of your affirmations, what might the words be that I then vſed, and which ſo mightily diſliked you? I remember that when you extolled father <hi>Parſons,</hi> auowing him to haue procured, &amp; done more good to our country, then any other that liued theſe many yeres: I anſwered, that I could ſo litle be of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as I verily thought him of meaner deſerts in that point, then any other that was a Catholick &amp; loued his country-men. And thus much I hope I ſhall be able to make good by euidence of moe particulars,
<pb n="1006" facs="tcp:16974:113"/> then your ſelf or any other ſhall be able to diſproue. Further I recall, that when you would free father <hi>Parſons</hi> from writing any vntruths, I replyed and ſaid, I could reprooue his pen of many, which now againe I ſhould haue no ſcruple to double ſpeake it, might not the ſame miniſter an occaſion of a new diſlike vnto you; yea and to all too that he hath ſhewed in ſome number of his actions as little ſinceritie, as truth in his writings. No doubt you will heere cry fye on paſſion. But patient your ſelfe, and thinke if I be put to prooue it, I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſhew it to be rather the iſſue of true charitie, then of choler or paſſion. For father <hi>Parſons</hi> being but one, and one who alreadie in many places carrieth but a hard report; and thoſe of whom he taketh his pleaſure being many, and ſuch as euery where moſt men ſpeake well of, and the matters wherein they are accuſed by him very foule: reaſon and conſcience tell, if proofes were alike of both ſides (as I take them to be much vnlike) yet that it were a point of greater cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie rather to thinke that father <hi>Parſons</hi> ſtrained a point in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, then to condemne ſo many as ſtand accuſed, and of like offences.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer where you ſay <hi>I exacted an oath of you for concealing my ſpeeches,</hi> I verily thinke you are miſtaken. My reaſon is, becauſe I do not remember that for theſe many yeares ſpace, I euer exacted an oath of any in what ſecreſie ſoeuer, but only contented my ſelfe with an aſſured promiſe. Or be it as you ſay, I do now free you of the bond, and giue you moſt franke leaue to diuulge it to whome, and how many, you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>You notifie in your Letter, <hi>that you neuer regarded to put your ſelfe in my companie ſince you heard me ſpeake ſuch vncharitable words</hi> (as you terme them) <hi>againſt a religious perſon.</hi> Well, I hope as good men as your ſelfe will make no conſcience to be in my companie.</p>
                  <p>But why I pray you do you ſpecifie thus much of your diſpoſition vnto me, the knowledge thereof no more auailing? Is it for that my ſelfe and the world ſhould ſee how exactlie you obey the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of holie ſcripture, <hi>Cum detractoribus non commiſcearis,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie not with detractours? I do not beleeue it, becauſe I can not beleeue that you are alike ignorant, as to take that to be detraction which is ſpoken in refutation of defaming vntruths, in defence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and in preſeruing the odour of our good names, as alſo in diſcharging the bond that God nature; &amp; the duties of our function lay vpon vs, being Prieſts as well as father <hi>Parſons,</hi> and hauing the
<pb n="1007" facs="tcp:16974:113"/> particular charge of more ſoules then (I thinke) he hath, and abiding within the reach of our countrie-perils, from which he long ſince for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking our campe, hath reſcued himſelfe. Or if you be ſo ignorant, that you know not to put difference betweene chalke and cheeſe, yet why are you more nice to come into my companie, then you are to conuerſe (and moſt affectionately) with others, who by toong and pen, in ſecret and in publick, and with diſcouerie of infinite more paſſion, haue at once ranſacked the good name and eſtimation of many Prieſts, whereof ſome alſo (how vile a wretch ſoeuer my ſelfe am) are imputed no whit their inferiours, either for vertue, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, experience, ſufferance, or learning, except in the glorie of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious name, or title of authoritie. I ſay ranſacked their good names and eſtimation, by denouncing them to be ſchiſmatikes, to be fallen from Gods Church, to be excommunicate, irregular, without facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to miniſter Sacraments vnworthily, to continue in a damnable ſtate, to bring mortall ſinne vpon thoſe that partake with vs in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, or ſerue vs at Maſſe, and deliuering the precious body of our Sauiour to our penitents, to deliuer poyſon. But I will leaue you to your partiall ſcruples, and ſtirre this puddle no further, nor aske you moe queſtions, but deſcend to another point.</p>
                  <p>Whether the Letter you wrote right before the comming ouer of his Holines Breue, were fulleſt of moſt vnſeeming and bad termes, let the by-words and aſſertions folowing taken out of the ſaid Letter, and by you imputed vnto me, beare witnes for me: namely, <hi>diſobedient, factious, directlie againſt the authoritie of his Holines, as all but wilfull blind men may eaſily diſcerne: obstinate, reſisting lawfull authoritie: wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, obstinacie, diſobedient diſpoſition: my credit to be in the waine: my preſent ſtate is adiudged ſchiſme; and my perſisting therein feared a reuolt.</hi> Now Sir be iudge your ſelfe, whether theſe termes (and yet theſe were not all that your Letter contained) be not in number ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and of that qualitie, as may well verifie that your Letter was fulleſt of vnſeeming and bad termes? Certes whatſoeuer you thinke, my ſelfe made alwayes conſcience to ſhew your Letter to any Lay perſon, nor did the partie either reade the ſame, or heard it read to my knowledge, what intelligence ſoeuer was aduertiſed of her ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thereupon vnto you. And for Prieſts, I neuer ſhewed it to any, who did not condemne it for a moſt bold and vncomely kind of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that I ſay no worſe.</p>
                  <p>You aduertiſe, <hi>that one who indured the authoritie as impatientlie as
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:16974:114"/> my ſelfe, is become an Apoſtata, and that other of our companie liue ſi ſcandalouſlie, as good men thinke them nigheſt to ruine.</hi> Sir, if by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtata you meane M. <hi>Butler</hi> (as I thinke you can meane none other) then muſt I ſay you do vs iniurie, for Maiſter <hi>Butler</hi> neuer tooke part with vs, for ought that euer I knew or heard, but was alwayes of out Arch-prieſt his ſide, and now ſince his fall, hath not letted to inſult and preferre his caſe before ours, in reſpect his faculties were neuer taken from him, as Maiſter <hi>Muſhes</hi> and mine were, and ſtill are. And by whom you meane the other part of your ſpeeches, I neither know nor can coniecture. But if you vnderſtand them by any of thoſe that ſubſcribed to the Appeale, or that refuſed to giue their names to the cunning drift of <hi>olim dicebamur,</hi> I am the more ſorie, but ſhall not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue you, till I ſee it true in the effect.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer you auouch, <hi>that thoſe men which now are moſt obstinate to obey, laboured all they could at Rome to make me and other their friends Archbiſhops and Biſhops.</hi> Surely, hardnes of beliefe in the reports that make againſt vs, is not your fault, God graunt your facilitie or raſhnes therein be no greater. What were their names Sir, that ſo mightily laboured our promotion at <hi>Rome?</hi> My ſelfe knoweth none that were there to labour it, ſaue only Doctor <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and Maiſter <hi>Charnock,</hi> and the one of them liuing out of the Realme, is no way ſubiect to Maiſter <hi>Blackwels</hi> authoritie, and therefore neither <hi>moſt obstinate,</hi> nor obſtinate at all <hi>to obey</hi> as you affirme. But did theſe two or either of them labour to make me, or any others within our Realme, I ſay not Archbiſhops, for that is too fabulous, but Biſhops? Let the records of their examination be reueiwed, and it will euidentlie appeare that neither of them euer named other for Biſhops, but only Doctor <hi>Elie,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Barret.</hi> And how did they alſo labour this preferment? You ſay, <hi>that they laboured it all they could.</hi> And what poſſiblie could that all be, when they were committed cloſe priſoners, and apart, ere they had entred into any courſe of dealing, or throughlie mentioned their intentions, and ſo continued in that kind of indurance, till father <hi>Parſons</hi> had made all ſure by getting forth a Breue for confirmation of his plotted authoritie. Me thinks you ſhould do well, for ſo much as you write, that <hi>ſome are moſt obstinate to obey,</hi> to particularize their names, and let vs and others know them. But I dare ſay, you can not name the Prieſt in our companie, who hath refuſed to obey Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> ſince the confirmation of his authoritie, in any point, or iot ſoeuer, that our reaſon, reading, and the counſell of the learned, hath
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:16974:114"/> thought vs bound vnto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or not clearely reſolued the contrary.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>you will prooue where one at leaſt of my friends ſaid, that for certaine I ſhould be a Biſhop.</hi> Sir, I could wiſh I did know whether the intelligencer did here my friend to appoint the time, when, or within which, I ſhould be made a Biſhop; for if he did, and the time be paſt, he, or you, or both, may boldly tell my friend (vnleſſe difference in your ſtates do make it ill nurture) that his certaintie did greatlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him. But let this be as it may be, yet what worthie exception can the report bring againſt me, vnleſſe I had all the toongs of my friends tyed in a ſtring, as they can not ſpeake ought belonging vnto me, but by my aſſent or prompting? Can you, or your intelligencer, or any other prooue, or wil ſay, that I ſoothed my friend in the ſpeech, or that I heard it, and did not reprehend him, or her, whatſoeuer the ſpeaker was, for the ſame? If you can prooue thus much, you ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, otherwiſe prouing what you can, you ſay nothing that is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall againſt me in this point.</p>
                  <p>Finally, <hi>to that you ſay, that if at the firſt the authoritie had bin caſt vpon me, as it was vpon Maiſter</hi> Blackwell, <hi>I would vpon ſuch good grounds as he did, haue accepted and exerciſed the ſame, with out testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of a Breue to confirme it;</hi> I thus anſwere in few words: I confeſſe I knew not of certaintie what I ſhould haue done if the accident had ſo fallen out; but if you will haue my coniecture, and what my thoughts now giue me, I do verily perſwade my ſelfe, that if I had made, and ſet downe in writing the like reaſons in the diſallowance &amp; reproofe of the other kind of gouernment before intended, as Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> did, and ſo greatly to his owne liking, I ſhould not doubtleſſe ſo at the firſt and with like applauſe, haue admired and congratulated the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. For what one reaſon did his Reuerence alleage in miſlike of the gouernment he impugned and went againſt, which did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude as much and as directlie againſt this ſubordination, which, his complying with the Ieſuites, and actioning for them, (as beſide other<note place="margin">To the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector.</note> teſtimonie, his letter of the firſt of Ianuary beareth witnes) haue ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and procured to himſelfe? The chiefe reaſon he vſed, and which carried moſt weight was, that we Seminarie prieſts hauing liued now in <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> more then twentie yeares in great peace, and with like fruit of our labours, without any ſuperioritie conſtituted among vs, it could not be thought either wiſedome, or pollicie, or other then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme follie, if after ſo long experience of a happie ſtate, we ſhould goe about to ordeine a ſubordination; and therefore he for his part
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:16974:115"/> did condemne, and would euer be againſt any ſuch innouation, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the preſent ſuite and afflictions of our Countrie. Againe, when Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> reaſoned with me in this matter, among other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, he inſiſted moſt in this, that the kind of gouernment purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed was very defectiue, preiudiciall, and faultie, in that it did aſſigne but one onely Superiour ouer all the Prieſts throughout the whole Realme; adding, that if he ſhould liue to the conuerſion of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, he would for ſo much as ſhould lye in him, ſolicite that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks might be deuided into moe Sees: for that as he then affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the Dioces were greater, and the vnder-paſtors moe in number then the trauels of one man could well gouerne: And therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit (quoth he) that we ſhould haue a Superiour appointed, yet it were moſt vnmeete, that there ſhould be but one made in the whole Realme.</p>
                  <p>By that which is ſaid I would ſay, that how deſirous ſoeuer you or others thinke me of authoritie (a fault of which mine owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth not much reprehend me, and I thanke my Lord Ieſu for the grace) I ſhould not, hauing before vſed the like reaſons, and ſpeeches, haue accepted of the authoritie in the manner that Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> did, or if ſo I had with moſt ioy accepted thereof, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all peraduenture I ſhould not before the receipt of a Breue or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apoſtolicall inſtrument, alike violently haue inforced the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of my bretheren thereunto, with like ſpeede, with like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, with like condemnation, and wrack of their good names, and trouble of no fewer (as I thinke) then of a thouſand ſoules.</p>
                  <p>To make an end, I let paſſe vnanſwered the exception you ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie againſt me, for writing, that you were in times paſt beholding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and that you ſpared not to interpret the words in the ſence that was furtheſt from my meaning, and thereupon alſo to inferre, that moſt pleaſed your ſelfe. For my leaue-taking I pray you if you write againe (which I do not deſire) that you would write more to the purpoſe, and with fewer failes, or not to miſlike if I omit to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere you. Fare you well, Ianuary 29. 1600.</p>

                  <p>I Hope the truth of the contents, but eſpecially the nature of the occaſions which inforced me to write, being the defence of my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiltines, do ſufficientlie of themſelues without other iuſtification, cleere me from blame, or vndoubtedly from that manifeſt kind of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:16974:115"/> blame, as might iuſtly, or colourably induce our Arch-prieſt to lay ſo heauie cenſures vpon me, without ſo much as citing me before, or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the particulars and ſuch proofes as I could make of that I had written. This I truſt is ſo euident to common ſenſe, and palpable to the dulleſt vnderſtanding, that it were waſt labour to dilate thereof, and greater idlenes to ſtand to confirme it by authorities.

And if againſt Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> (as I do not ſee how it can be ſo taken, becauſe in one point I wrote no more then his Reuerence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed vnto me: and in the other, I ſayd only what my ſelfe ſhould not haue done, as my thoughts then gaue me, if ſo I had bin in his place) yet the iniury I did him, being properly againſt himſelfe, he could not by the <note n="a" place="margin">4. q. 4.

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:16974:116"/> ſpecified; I will diſcend to the other cauſe which as yet remayneth vnexamined.</p>
                  <p>The third and laſt cauſe which our Arch-prieſt alleageth for ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, interdicting, and redoubling the reuocation of my facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is: <hi>for that there were three names ſubſcribed to the Appeale, and the Priests whoſe names they were, denyed to haue conſented to the letter, or cauſes prefixed before the Appeale. The blame of which fraude, his Reuerence knew not</hi> (as he writeth) <hi>to whome ſooner to impute it, then to me the ſender of the Appeale vnto him.</hi> When the will is vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentlie bent vnto a thing, ſhe occupieth oftſoone the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in deuiſing reaſons to make it lawfull, wherein often ſhe ſheweth her ſelfe ſo powreable, that inchanting the vnderſtanding, ſhe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it to receiue in groſſe error, in ſtead of truth. What could be written with leſſe reaſon, or more contrary to the ordinances of the Catholick Church, then for our Arch-prieſt to declare by a publick inſtrument, addreſſed to the whole Clergie, and Catholick laytie, that I had fallen into the Cenſures of ſuſpenſion, and interdict, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the loſſe of all my faculties, hauing taken them from me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt halfe a yeare before, and at that preſent to impoſe a new the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of them againe <hi>for a fault</hi> (to vſe his owne words) <hi>which indeede he knew not, on whom rather to lay it, then on me?</hi> Yea and to adde, that <hi>he ought of neceſſitie ſo to do,</hi> hauing neither cited me before, nor any way heard or demaunded, what I could ſay to the contrarie. God, who is the viewer of all ſecrets, and to whoſe eyes (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle<note place="margin">Hebr. 4.</note> writeth) all things are naked and open, would not condemne our Protoparents <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> notwithſtanding his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie moſt thoroughlie knew, they had tranſgreſſed his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">Geneſis 3.</note> before he had both ſummoned <hi>Adam</hi> to appeare, and heard his and <hi>Eues</hi> defence in the matter. And if almighty God knowing not only what we can ſay, but what we will ſay in defence, would for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to man, ſpecially to ſuperiours, vouchſafe notwithſtanding to cite and heare the offendor before he proceeded to condemnation, and the inflicting of puniſhment: how much more meete, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary is it, that inferiour Iudges, who know nothing but by receipt of their eye, and eare, ſhould not without ſummons and examination before, puniſh or condemne any, but where the fault and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are moſt certaine, alike apparant, and altogether incapable of any defence or tergiuerſation?

It hath bin ſhewed before, that in all probabilitie our<note place="margin">Pag. 182. ex ſequ.</note> Arch-prieſt hath no authoritie to ſuſpend from the Altar; and for moſt certaine, he hath no authoritie to interdict Prieſts or any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick: therefore theſe Cenſures annexed to his Decrees, neither is nor can be leſſe then an vnlawfull exceſſe of the authoritie graunted. But let vs ſuppoſe that the word [<hi>ſuspending</hi>] in the Conſtitutiue Letter, giueth authoritie to the Arch-prieſt to ſuſpend from the Altar, and miniſtration of all Sacraments: and let vs alſo ſuppoſe that the words [<hi>eccleſiaſticall penalties</hi>] do giue him authoritie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict, whereof there is no colour at all, as we haue proued before:<note place="margin">Pag. 185.</note> yet becauſe the Cardinals letter ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrued, doth not giue our Arch-prieſt authoritie to vſe theſe cenſures how and when he liſteth, but onely that he may inflict theſe cenſures, <hi>if we after due admonitions and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The words of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutiue let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pag. 2.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>From theſe premiſſes we inferre, that albeit our Arch-prieſt hath authoritie to make Decrees, which we neither denye nor affirme, though we rather thinke he can not, vnleſſe he firſt ſummon vs, and propoſe (as the Conſtitutiue letter directeth) the things he intendeth<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 6. § 3.</note> to decree: yet we aſſuredly beleeue that his Reuerence hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie nor iuriſdiction at all, to annexe the cenſures of ſuſpenſion, or interdict, or the penaltie of leeſing our faculties to be incurred <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> if we diſobey and breake his Decrees. And the reaſons why we be thus perſwaded, are, firſt becauſe this were preſently, before any fact done by vs, to paſſe and impoſe the ſaid cenſures, and eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall<note place="margin">Vgolinus ta. 1. ca. 9. § 6 nu. 3.</note> penaltie, and to lay them in the Decree, for it, to execute them, without any his further concurrance, when the offence is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But our Arch-prieſt hath no authoritie to paſſe and inflict a Cenſure, or to reſtraine and reuoke faculties (as appeareth by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:16974:117"/> of the Cardinals letter) ſaue only after the committing of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and after charitable admonitions and reprehenſions for the ſame: and therefore till the offence be committed, and the reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions firſt vſed, he can not paſſe and impoſe any cenſure or penaltie. And although the publiſhing of a Decree be a ſufficient admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet the publiſhing thereof doth not nor can not ſupplie (as we thinke) the reprehenſions, which by the preſcript forme of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutiue Letter is to be vſed before the inflicting of the ſaid penalties.</p>

And you ſpecified foure cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with a ſecond &amp;c. The firſt is, for that we defend our cauſe: then for that we aske ſatisfaction: thirdly for writing vnto you diuers letters full of contumelie or calumniations; partly publiſhed againſt your Reuerence, partly alſo againſt other Superiours; and laſtly, for that at this preſent we buſily beſtir our ſelues in manie matters againſt peace, with a third &amp;c. Moreouer you commaund the ſayd Aſſiſtants and Cleargie of <hi>England,</hi> to acquaint all Catholicks with what you haue done, leaſt haplie they receiue Sacraments of vs: concluding, that they ſhall vnderſtand moe things out of your common letters. My humble requeſt is, that you would vouchſafe to expreſſe theſe reſidues at length and plainely, as alſo what common letters you meane, and to whom we ſhall reſort for a ſight of them: otherwiſe in my poore iudgement the proceſſe will appeare hard. For to diuulge in this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious manner the taking away of our faculties, which heapeth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, and ſundire other damages vpon vs, and alike vnperfectlie or by halfes to recite the cauſes, and lay downe the puniſhment, as the reader through additions of <hi>et-cetera-es,</hi> is left, as it were to a wide

If your Reuerence tooke but all our faculties from vs, and the <hi>et-cetera-es</hi> adioyned im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie no Cenſure nor a notorious damnable ſtate; then I deſire to know the reaſon, why we may not miniſter, and the Laitie receiue at our hands the Sacrament of the holie Eucariſt, baptiſme, or extreme vnction, which your cauſatiue <hi>ne,</hi> ſeemeth, and by congruitie of ſpeech can not, as I thinke, but denie.

                  <p>Notwithſtanding which earneſt petition to our Arch-prieſt for his anſwere to the points, he, neuertheleſſe as if he had bin more then the Metrapolitane of <hi>England,</hi> and my ſelfe the meaneſt Prieſt on earth, returned me a ragged peece of paper, ſuch as would not much more then come about a mans thombe, with theſe words written in it, <hi>lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Suarez tom. 3. diſput. 16. ſect. 1. &amp; diſput. 72. ſect. 4. eod. to.</hi> together with a few broken ſpeeches by word of mouth, either not appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or not ſatisfying my demaunds, which alſo the meſſenger being a lay perſon, would not put downe vnder his hand nor atteſtate. The places he referred me vnto, teach, that Prieſts depriued of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall iuriſdiction, can not lawfullie miniſter any Sacrament, and how many wayes they ſinne mortallie that miniſter a Sacrament vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthilie,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:16974:124"/> or others in receiuing of a Sacrament at the hands of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie Miniſter. So that his intent in quoting the places was plaine, <hi>viz.</hi> that I could not, he hauing taken away all my faculties, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter any Sacrament at all, and that I liued in notorious mortall ſinne, and therefore none, without ſinning deadlie, could receiue a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of me. Wrongs, which as I pray God of his mercie to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue him, ſo do I hope, that neither he, nor all his adherents, ſhall be able to prooue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they giue hands, and deuiſe all the quircks and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in the world for bolſtering vp the ſlaunder.</p>
                  <p>And before we deſcend to the examination of the cauſes, which his Reuerence alledgeth in the Inſtrument for the puniſhment he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth, it ſeemeth neceſſarie to ſpeake a word or two, explicating the beginning of his Letter, as alſo for declaring how and when he may take away our faculties by the authoritie graunted.</p>
                  <p>Some nine or tenne dayes before the arriuall of his Holines Breue, for confirmation of the new authoritie, Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> ſuſpended<note place="margin">See more of this matter pag. 52.</note> the vſe of Maiſter <hi>Muſhes</hi> faculties, Maiſter <hi>Hebornes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we would not admit him, before he ſhould ſhew his Holines Letters for proofe of the promotion. Which refuſall being lawfull according to all lawes, he tearmeth <hi>a manifeſt diſobedience:</hi> and our receiuing of him vpon the firſt appearing of the Breue, he nameth <hi>our ſubmiſſion;</hi> and the remouing of the ſuſpenſion, <hi>the restitution of our faculties,</hi> all ſpoken vnproperlie, and the firſt alſo very wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie.</p>
                  <p>Touching the other point, how and when his iuriſdiction autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth him to take away faculties, there can not be made a better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration thereof, then are the ſelfe words of the Conſtitutiue Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being the ſet forme of his Commiſſion, and from which he can<note place="margin">Gloſſ. in ca. cum dilecta de reſcript.</note> not ſwarue a haires breadth, which are theſe: <hi>To restraine or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the vſe of faculties if there ſhall be neede, or to take them whollie away if neceſſitie constraine.</hi> So that of force, either neede or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie muſt be the antecedent to his correction: neede, if he reſtraine our faculties, or neceſſitie if he take them away. And when is this? Marie as the ſame letter ſpecifieth and ſeemeth to limite, <hi>when his Reuerence hath ſummoned vs, and propoſed with the aduiſe of his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, the things which either he ſhall iudge neceſſarie to be obſerued by vs, or ſhall thinke needefull to be written to Rome, or to Doctor Barret Preſident of Doway, and we in the ſame matters ſhall ſhewe our ſelues diſobedient, vnquiet, or contumaceous: then that his Reuerence after due
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16974:124"/> admonitions, and reprehenſions vſed in brotherlie charitie, may either take away, or ſuspend our faculties.</hi> Which paſſage (being the words of the Cardinals letter, and comming after the generall graunt of reſtraining or reuoking faculties, and in the place where his Grace deliuered the forme, how and when the Archprieſt ſhould vſe the ſaid puniſhing iuriſdiction) appeareth to be the true, and intended expoſition and limits of the former clauſe [<hi>when there ſhall be neede, or neceſſitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine.</hi>] Or whether this be ſo or no, yet it is euident by the diſcourſe of reaſon, and the teſtimonie of the learned, that this <hi>neede or neceſſitie</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Arg. gloſſ. in ca. vt debitus de Appell. verb. ex ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionabile.</note> muſt be conſtrued according to the truth of matters, and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the priuate conceipt or opinion of our Archprieſt. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer father <hi>Parſons</hi> the plotter and penner of the ſubordination, would perchaunce make our Arch-prieſt iudge in the matter, and not truth and reaſon; yet we haue no doubt, but the Cardinall the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and are moſt ſure, that his Holines the confirmer, would haue this [<hi>neede or neceſſitie</hi>] to be taken according to the veritie of the matter in it ſelfe, that is <note n="l" place="margin">Arg. 11. q. 3. nemo E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcoporum &amp; ca. ſacro de ſent. excom.</note> for a certaine and manifeſt neede or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, and not according to any mans formed fancie, or corrupt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. And if the Cardinall, and his Holines had this meaning by the words, as we may not miſtruſt but they had, then can not our Arch-prieſt, (words eſpecially deriuing iuriſdiction, being <note n="m" place="margin">Ca. intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligentia de verb. ſignif.</note> to be vnderſtood not as they ſound, but according to the intention of the ſpeaker) ſuſpend or take away faculties, but when there is a true and a reall <hi>neede</hi> or <hi>neceſſitie,</hi> which in this ſubiect (the nature of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and circumſtances of place and perſons conſidered) can not be, but a matter of mortall ſinne, and ſuch a mortall ſinne, as is cleare by the euidence of the tranſgreſſion it ſelfe, and that the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent was admoniſhed before of the fault, and did not amend. For if admonition would morallie, or did reforme the partie, there can be no neceſſitie, or neede either of repealing, or ſuſpending his faculties. Now to the examination of the cauſes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt cauſe that our Arch-prieſt alledgeth is, <hi>for that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our cauſe.</hi> O Lord, would not a man wonder to heare ſuch a cauſe alleadged, if ſo he knew that we were neuer iuridicallie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and leſſe by ſuch a ſuperiour Iudge, as from whoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence we neither did nor could appeale. Verily the ignorance or exigent muſt needes be great, when that is brought for a cauſe of robbing Prieſts of their faculties in ſuch a countrie as ours, which the lawe of God, Nature, and all Nations doth allow, namely, the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:16974:125"/> vncondemned to maintaine and defend their vnguiltineſſe, and the reputation of their good names.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond cauſe put downe, is, our <hi>demaund of ſatisfaction.</hi> Strange and very ſtrange how the asking of ſatisfaction, that is a recompence <note n="n" place="margin">D. Tho. in 4 dist 15. q. 1. art. 1. q. 3.</note> according to the equalitie of iuſtice for iniuries committed, can be reputed a cauſe of taking away faculties from Prieſts liuing in <hi>England;</hi> and the iniurie, for which ſatisfaction was demaunded, not diſproued, yea, in the immediate and direct conſequence approued to be a true and grieuous iniurie by the cenſure of a famous Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie. But what was the ſatisfaction demaunded, and which did alike aggrauate the matter, as for it our faculties muſt be taken away, without proofe of the cauſe or citation? Father <hi>Liſter</hi> in a publick Treatiſe condemned vs of Schiſme, our Arch-prieſt approueth the condemnation, and in ſeuerall letters not vnſtiflie maintaineth the ſame: our ghoſtlie children by his and the Ieſuites report, or defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations rather, were put in feare to haue ſpirituall participation with vs: and we deſired the retractation of the ſaid treatiſe, as alſo of the reſolution which our Arch-prieſt ſent abroade as receiued from <hi>Rome,</hi> charging vs with the ſame crime. And are not theſe, trow ye, capitall demaunds, being duties of iniuſtice by all lawes; if ſo we be cleare of the crimes pretended, as now the Pope himſelfe on the firſt of Aprill laſt, after the full hearing of the matter, and after all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations, ſhifts, and deſcants, that father <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſons,</hi> his friends, and the aduocates of our Arch-prieſt could amplifie, hath declared for vs, and freed as well from the imputation of rebellion and ſchiſme, as from the ignominie of the diſobedience obiected, for not admitting the ſubordination, before the comming ouer of his Breue in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſame. Who is more blind, than he, that will not ſee? And holie ſcripture ſaith, <hi>haec cogitauerunt &amp; errauerunt; excaecauit</hi>

                  <p>The third cauſe rendred by our Arch-prieſt for the taking away of my faculties, is, <hi>for that I wrote diuerſe letters vnto him full of contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies, or calumniations, partly publiſhed againſt himſelfe, partly againſt other Superiours.</hi> In my requeſts aboue ſpecified, I beſought his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to name the letter vnto me, or ſet downe the words, wherein I had miſdemeaned my ſelfe, either towards him, or any other Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. What could I do more, my ſelfe not remembring any ſuch
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:16974:125"/> thing, for comming to the vnderſtanding of my fault? But as reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as this petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was, yet his fatherhood not liking, or not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauing to anſwere me directly, only willed me to recount what I had written: and this was all that either then, or euer ſince I could receiue from him, touching the particulars of the foreſaid generall charge.</p>
                  <p>Let others iudge of the courſe, and how farre the ſame is from ſhow of all good dealing, that any Prieſt his faculties ſhould be taken from him, vpon any generall cauſe, without deſcending to the particular, or further proofe of the generall, then by willing him <hi>to remember what he had written.</hi> The Sheriffe of <hi>London</hi> commeth to <hi>Symphronius</hi> and taketh away all his goods, pretending that he wrote vnto him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine letters, wherein ſundrie hye treaſons were contained. <hi>Symphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> robbed in this manner of his goods, demaundeth the Sheriffe who made the ſeiſure, to tell him what letters of his theſe were, and what were the treaſonable words in particular, for which he thus op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth him? The Sheriffe biddeth him remember what he wrote, and other aunſwere giueth none. Who will not admire the vniuſtice, the partie thus rifled, being neither condemned, nor the treaſons par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularized, nor proofe made of any? Againe, how would our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie exclaime of the crueltie, if the Lord chiefe Iuſtice ſhould put a Counſeller from the barre, and forbid him his practiſe, alleadging for cauſe, that he had ſpoken diſhonourablie of him, but would not recite what ſpeeches they were, nor when he ſpake them, nor ſuffer him to pleade and prooue his innocencie in the accuſation? Our Arch-prieſt his vſage is in all points like: he tooke away our faculties before the fault was prooued, the vſe of them being the onely trade we haue to liue by; neither will he ſuffer vs to argue and defend our vnguiltines, but beſide the prohibition and iniuſtice, defameth vs in generalities: and requeſted to name the particulars, he refuſeth and biddeth vs to examine our ſelues: a reaſon that the greateſt tyrant in the world may yeeld for the fowleſt wrong that can be committed. Some of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnto him are ſet downe before, others follow, as the contents of them do fall in with the matter treated, and the reader may iudge how full they are of contumelies or calumniations, that is, of <note n="o" place="margin">D. Tho. 2. 2. q. 72. art. 1. &amp; q. 73. art. 1. c.</note> open reprochfull words againſt his, or any other Superiours honour, and of impoſing of <note n="p" place="margin">Idem 2. 2. q 68. art. 3. c.</note> falſe and malicious crimes vpon either. Certes many of thoſe that haue already ſeene my letters, rather take my manner of writing to the Arch-prieſt for ouer-ceremonious and ſubmiſſiue, then for contumelious &amp; calumniatiue. And I verily aſſure my ſelfe,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:16974:126"/> that the partialleſt reader who ſhall not wilfullie depoſe all regard of equitie and conſcience, can not but witnes for me againſt the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; if he duly conſider of the many iniuries his Reuerence hath done me, and the infinite prouocations which his common made let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue giuen, eſpecially that by name which he wrote to Maiſter <hi>Iackson</hi> the 18. of March. In which his Reuerence not onely calleth me the ſonne of <hi>Beliall,</hi> but applieth beſides this ſentence of holie Scripture vnto me, <hi>ab immundo, quid mundabitur, &amp; à mendace, quid</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccle. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>verum dicetur?</hi> What ſhall be cleanſed by the vncleane, and what truth can be ſpoken by a lyer? Which words as well the ordinarie gloſſe, as <hi>Lyra,</hi> and other expoſitours, do appropriate to the Diuell onely, and can be verified of none other, and much leſſe of a Prieſt; who, how wicked and abhominable ſoeuer his inward life be, yet doth he miniſteriouſlie cleanſe, either when he baptiſeth or abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: and although the Diuell ſometimes telleth truth, yet becauſe he neuer telleth truth but to the end to deceiue, and for that ſuch actes <note n="q" place="margin">D Th. 1. 2. q. 1. art. 3. &amp; q. 19. art. 4. 6. &amp; 7. &amp; 2. 2. q 43. art. 3. &amp; q. 64. art. 7.</note> take their denomination of the end: therefore the Diuell alwayes intending deceipt, no truth, as holie Scripture affirmeth, can be expected from him. Which kind of habituate and obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wickednes and reprobation, being not to be found in any mortall man, the place can not be truly ſpoken of any, but of the Diuell: and if of none except the Diuell, doubtleſſe his Reuerence ſhewed either much ſplene, or ſome ignorance in applying this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to me, whom yet he hath not proued to be of ſo infectious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe and lying ſpirit, as that I defile whatſoeuer I haue hand in, and can tell no truth but to the end to beguile.</p>
                  <p>Let the premiſſes and other his writings be pondered, which are not ſcant in his letters, and I do not doubt but that my reioynders will ſeeme as temperate and reſpectiue, as reaſon, dutie, and prieſtlie mildnes did bind me vnto. To end this point, I do not remember that euer I mentioned any Superiour in my letters to him, ſaue onely father <hi>Garnet,</hi> neither him in any reprochfull or contumelious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: which maketh me the more to muſe, with what libertie of penne and conſcience his Reuerence could pretend and diuulge the taking away of my faculties to be <hi>for writing letters vnto him full of contention, or calumniation againſt other Superiours;</hi> when I neuer touched in my ſaid letters but one onely, and him after no vnſeemely manner, his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of father <hi>Listers</hi> treatiſe, and the nature of his owne aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions conſidered, which were very falſe, iniurious, and ſhameleſlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:16974:126"/> againſt me in particular, as the ſpecialties of the Appeale do teſtifie.</p>
                  <p>The fourth cauſe that our Arch-prieſt giueth for depriuing me of my faculties, is, <hi>for that euen at the inſtant when he tooke them from me, I attempted many things againſt peace.</hi> This he ſaith, but doth not ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie wherein, nor would his Reuerence, when after I wrote vnto him to know the particulars, anſwere me a word. The truth was, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding our intention to appeale from him, and thinking Maiſter <hi>Muſh</hi> and my ſelfe to be two of the chiefeſt in the action, he knew no meanes how better to take his peniworths of vs before-hand, then to disfurniſh vs of our faculties. And to cloake the reuenge, his Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence deuiſed the foreſaid foure cauſes, with a coople <hi>etceteraes,</hi> as loope holes to let in, what he, or his friends could afterwards eſpie out, of more truth or moment againſt vs. But let our encountering of father <hi>Listers</hi> paradoxe, and our withſtanding the imputation of enormous diſobedience, be exempted (which conſcience &amp; bounden reſpect of our good names tyed vs vnto) and the whole world can not giue an inſtance, wherein we hindered the making of peace: nay we aboue any others laboured and preſſed the chiefe meanes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing true peace, as the diſcourſe of the next Reaſon will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
                  <p>It appeareth by that litle which is ſaid in anſwere to the reaſons of our Arch-prieſt, that there was <hi>neither neede nor neceſſitie,</hi> nor any iuſt cauſe occurring, why he ſhould bereaue vs of our faculties, eſpecially before ſummons, and conuiction of the fault. To ſay, our miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours were notorious, and therefore no neede of citing or triall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the inflicting of the puniſhment, is too bare a refuge, and ouer common, nor other, then may be alleaged in the wrongfulleſt accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that can be imagined.

                  <p>By which places and others before quoted it is very plaine, that our Arch-prieſt did not only exceede the bounds of the Conſtitutiue Letter, in the manner of taking away our faculties, but that he did alſo breake the lawes <note n="a" place="margin">Clem. ca. pastoralis de re iudica.</note> of Nature, and holy Church in ſuch his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and the fact neuertheleſſe of no obligation: which may alſo be confirmed by other arguments.</p>

                     <hi>Nauar</hi> writeth, in eccleſiaſticall rights. So that the poſſeſſion and vſe of our faculties being vnto vs
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:16974:127"/> in ſteed of benefices, and in a ſort, couenanted for, and deſerued, as it hath bin before ſhewed; it followeth directlie vpon the ſame reaſon, that we cannot lawfully be diſpoſſeſſed of our faculties before we be heard, and iudiciall examination had of the offence for which they are to be taken away. But of that, which may not lawfully be done, there can be <hi>no neede or neceſſitie,</hi> which are the limits and direction, when our Arch-prieſt may take away faculties, as appeareth by the Cardinals letter; therefore this not obſerued but exceeded, <note n="e" place="margin">D.

                  <p>Againe, the Diuines and Canoniſts agree, that regular or religious Prieſts, being once allowed by the Biſhop to heare confeſſions, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not againe be imbarred thereof, but <note n="f" place="margin">Henriques li. 3. de poeni. ca. 6. nu. 6.

                     <hi>cauſa cognita &amp; probata,</hi> vpon examination and proofe of the cauſe pretended.

                  <p>Hence, as by other perticulars, the iniuſtice and oppreſſion of our Arch-prieſt appeare great in diſpoſſeſſing vs of our faculties, onely vpon the bare naming of a cauſe, without citation or proofe of the cauſe alleaged, a courſe contrarie to lawe, diuine, and eccleſiaſticall, and contrarie to the forme of all practiſe in the chriſtian world. Which meaſure alſo becommeth the more ouer-running in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and iniuſtice towards vs, in that his Reuerence, notwithſtanding the long want of our faculties, would not reſtore vs to our former ſtate vpon the order, and commaundement of his Holines <hi>Nuncio</hi> in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to whom himſelfe aſſigned me in his dimiſſories, as to the Iudge of my appellation; a more direct, and leſſe iuſtifiable kind of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by many degrees, then we can be charged with, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the condemnation and outcryes that haue bin made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for a long ſpace moſt violently againſt vs. The words of the

Now to conclude this our fourth Reaſon, we hope the premiſſes haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſhewed, that the authoritye which our Arch-prieſt poſſeſſeth, being very ample in it ſelfe, and infinitely more ample in the practiſe, maketh him a ſuperiour Prelate, and conſequently his Reuerence conteyned vnder the Extrauagant <hi>Iniunctae</hi> afore mentioned. And if ſo, as the largeneſſe of his authority and the ſcope of his Iuriſdiction reaching ouer <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> cannot but conclude him vnder the ſame: then all the power, wit, and learning of the aduerſe part can neuer proue vs to be in the leaſt point diſobedient, either vnto his Holines, the Cardinall Protector, or to Maiſter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> becauſe the ſayd Extrauagant commaundeth, and enacteth vnder a heauie penaltie, not to admit any Superiour Prelate promoted by the ſea A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick to the dignitie he is choſen to, without he firſt ſhew the letters of the ſame Sea for proofe of the preferment.

And the grounds why we tooke this to be a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable cauſe of iuſtifying our bearing off, were theſe that follow.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:16974:130"/>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the Magiſtrates haue in their hands, and <hi>de facto</hi> haue ſhewed to ſome priſoners at the time of their examinations for proofe, and to exaggerate the diſloyalties and treaſons obiected, one, or mo letters which they affirme to be father <hi>Parſons,</hi> wherein his concurrance and furtherance to an inuaſion were expreſſed: then the mans reſtleſſe tampering in State matters, being reported to haue profered, and reprofered the Crowne of our Countrie to ſeuerall Princes, now to one, now to another, as the meeting of matters and oportunities could moſt recommend and credit his words, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the perſonage with hope thereof: thirdly, the inceſſant ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation, which the Magiſtrate proteſteth, that he hath vſed with forraine Potentates, and the attempts, which, as the ſame Magiſtrate affirmeth, haue thereon enſued for a conqueſt of our countrie. So as the Magiſtrate vnderſtanding (as common fame could not but bring it to his hearing) that the ſubordination was the worke of father <hi>Parſons,</hi> our feare was, leaſt the politick State would deeme vs coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iutors and creatures combined with him, if we had admitted the Subordination vpon no greater compulſion, then the Protectors letter, and conſequently, that we were perſons who did deſerue to be abandoned, and to haue the extremitie of the lawes proſecuted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. Could we therefore in common reaſon do leſſe, matters ſtanding in theſe termes, then deferre our acceptance of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, vntill his Holines had commaunded vs by Bull, Breue, or other papall inſtrument, or verball meſſage, to ſubiect our ſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; that ſo the State might ſee, our receiuing of the Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to be for any liking we caried towards father <hi>Parſons</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, but for obedience only towards the Sea Apoſtolick, and in a matter wherein the obſeruances of our religion bound vs, and the ſame not iuſtlie preiudiciall to the temporall ſtate? Verily we tooke this for ſo reaſonable and iuſt a cauſe, as we could not but ſtand thereupon, vnleſſe we would in our owne vnderſtanding haue ſhewed our ſelues cruell to our owne innocencie; of ill deſerts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Magiſtrate, in not remouing his wrong ſuſpition of vs when and how we might; ingratefull to our benefactors; vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of our owne liues; betrayers of the cauſe we profeſſe; enemies to the profeſſors thereof; and iniurious to the honor of Prieſthood: for that all theſe (her Maieſtie and the State not reading in our actions, that we were true diſlikers of all and ſingular his diſloyall practiſes and platformes) were like to receiue increaſe of affliction &amp; blemiſh,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:16974:130"/> by our admittance of the iuriſdiction, before ſuch time as his Holines had confirmed the ſame, &amp; thereby through the vertue of his ſupreme authoritie, freed both it and vs, from hauing part in father <hi>Parſons</hi> intentions, ſo farre as they were any whit diſloyall.</p>
               <p>Neither is father <hi>Parſons</hi> holden onely of our Magiſtrate for a Statiſt, or marchandizer of the Crowne and Diademe, though this were enough to eſtrange &amp; deforce vs from hauing any connexion, or partaking in ought with him: but his trauels and negotiations this way are become ſo notoriouſlie knowne, that euen <hi>Paſquine</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> (as intelligence is ſent vs) ſpeaketh in this manner of him:</p>

               <p>Touching the proper nature of our delaie vpon the foreſaid cauſe, we thinke, that the ſame will not onely appeare iuſt and reaſonable before any Tribunall vpon earth to our full excuſe, but that it will be found of that qualitie in the day of iudgement, when <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 5.

                  <p>VNwillingneſſe to ſhew my ſelfe either too quick in taking, or ouer-tender in brooking iniuries, hath hitherto not a little (as to me ſeemeth) ſtaid both toung and pen from due queſtioning and complaining; and would haue done longer, but that reports are now growne to the like head, as euen feare of offending through too great neglect of my good name, neceſſarily enforceth a more reſpectfull conſideration vpon me. My owne eares haue bin witnes (good Sir) and my friends euery where giue me to vnderſtand, how ſiniſterly I am talked of, for wronging (that I vſe but one, and no harder a tearme, albeit many and much harder be ſpread of me) the fathers of the Societie. Theſe are therefore to beſeech you, and in all right of charitie to intreate the receiuing of ſo much fauour, or rather not the vndue tribute of iuſtice from you, as to acquaint me with thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, wherein I haue reproueablie, either to your owne knowledge, or by ſuch information as will be ſtood vnto, miſcaried my ſelfe in word, deede, or demeanour againſt your ſelfe, or any of your ſocietie. I expect my full charge, and do no way deſire you to leaue any point vntouched, or not amplified to the moſt, whereof you hold me cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. Adding, that the plainer you deale with me herein, the better cauſe I haue to like you. Aduertiſing beſides, that for ſauing ſome of your friends credit ſo farre as the deliuery of like vntruths do diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, it importeth to alleage the moſt you can againſt me. If my leaue be deſired as no neede, I yeeld it franckly, becauſe I would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly dwell in ignorance of my ſinnes, nor omit ſatisfaction where I am bound to make it. Thus in briefe you haue my requeſt, and ſee the motiues, I praye affoord me the performance with the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. Fare you well with very good will, though the courſe (if with
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:16974:132"/> your priuitie) followed againſt me, ſheweth little good will. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember 5. 1598.</p>

                  <p>IF you be ſiniſterlie talked of for wronging our Societie: blame not<note place="margin">Father Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets anſwere.</note> him (I beſeech you) who, for all your ſtrangenes ceaſſeth not to loue you: and whome, for your hurtfull proceedings, loue inforceth to pittie you.</p>
                  <p>It hath bin alwayes my deſire, ſince that we purged our ſelues (I hope ſufficiently) from the malicious ſlaunders of ſome impudent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers, that all things ſhould (as much as is poſſible) be vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: and if all could not be induced to loue and affect vs, to beare their auerſion with patience &amp; ſilence, without following any courſe or purſuite againſt them: ſo, that if you heare either your ſelfe, or by any others, any ſiniſter reports againſt you, you may examine them beſt, whether they be true, and the reporters are to giue account on what ground they vtter them.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that as it hath pleaſed God to giue our Societie part in many glorious labours which in his holie Church are continuallie atchieued: ſo alſo very often times, yea ordinarily, doth he make vs<note place="margin">Note the matter of this our blame.</note> partakers of the afflictions and difficulties which do thence ariſe: and if any worthie thing be accounted worthie of blame, we are lightlie the firſt which are blamed.</p>
                  <p>It hath pleaſed his Holines of late to ordaine a certaine gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among vs. It hath bin receiued with ſingular liking of the moſt and beſt. God forbid, but that I and all my brethren, ſhould haue bin moſt ready to runne whither charitie and obedience did call vs, leaſt by diſobedience we ſhould contemne our Superior, or by ſchiſme and diuiſion be cut off from the head.</p>
                  <p>Some haue refuſed to acknowledge this head, much more to obey him. Their pretences are in euery ones mouth that haue heard of this authoritie: It is a thing deuiſed by the Ieſuites: The Superior is one
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:16974:133"/> of their owne chooſing: Why ſhould the Ieſuites appoint vs a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, more then we a Generall vnto them? It is the fine head of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parſons</hi> that hath inuented this: He hath giuen wrong informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Cardinall and his Holines: The Cardinall was alwayes partiall on the Ieſuites ſide: Some of neceſſitie muſt be ſent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme better: The meſſengers muſt procure that ſome aſſiſtants be choſen, who may not be thought to be partiallie affected to the Ieſuites: They muſt propound, to haue the gouernment of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge enlarged, as being ouer-ſtraite, or indiſcreete for our nation: Yea they muſt make ſuite that the Ieſuites be remoued from the gouernment of all Seminaries of our nation: And touching the miſſion of <hi>England</hi> in particular, all the Ieſuites muſt needes be called away.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and the like ſpeeches hauing bin vttered by ſuch, as either gathered voyces for another gouernment, or are knowne not to fauour this: what can it argue elſe, but that ſuch oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the Societie, as if no authoritie were to be liked, but which may beate downe the Ieſuites, or ſet them and other <hi>Reuerend Priests</hi> together by the eares? And verily, the ſucceſſe of matters ſince the authoritie of the <hi>Reuerend Arch-prieſt</hi> was diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, doth make many to feare, leaſt the ſecret intention (yet not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of all) of theſe which were the principall ſeekers, to erect a ſodalitie, or other ſuperioritie and ſubordination, was either am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, or ſeditious. For hauing now that very thing which they ſought for (although impoſed on other perſons then they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned) to reprehend and impugne the ſame, muſt needes make men ſuſpect, that they doe it, either becauſe they themſelues are not choſen, or becauſe ſuch were not choſen as might deale peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily with thoſe which they ought to tender. Both which affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſheweth them doubly vnworthie of gouernment. For what is ſo vnfit for honor, as ambition? And what haue we done, that all ſhould not affect vs? Yea by Gods great goodnes ſo it is (as we thinke) that if any affect vs not, the fault is in them, and not in vs. So that if they would haue themſelues, or others that do not affect vs (though otherwiſe ſeeming neuer ſo vertuous) to be choſen heads, let them firſt affect vs (ſo farre as in vertue they ought) that they may be worthie of gouernment.</p>
                  <p>Then you ſee (good Sir) it wanteth not probabilitie, that if any giue out that you wrong vs, it is becauſe you are thought to draw
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16974:133"/> backe from your Arch-presbyter, which you knowe whether it be ſo or no. And although I verily perſwade my ſelfe, that moſt of thoſe ſpeeches neuer proceeded from your mouth, yet thoſe that will be part of a diſcontented companie, of force muſt be contented to beare the reproch of many things which are done or ſayd amiſſe by a few, it being impoſſible that all men ſhould diſtinguiſh, and applie euery particular to the true authour. And verily, as it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me oftentimes to heare, and I reprehend it ſo often as I heare it ſpoken, that ſuch a one, or ſuch another who is not ioyned to the Archpresbyter, is condemned, as oppoſite to the Societie: and condemne ſuch manner of ſpeech for a fallacie, which we call as you know <hi>non cauſae vt cauſae:</hi> for in very deede, I would not haue them reprehended becauſe they are oppoſite againſt vs, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they acknowledge not their lawfull Superiour: ſo on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide muſt I needes acknowledge that it is, and by Gods grace will I alwayes procure, that it ſhall alwayes continue: that thoſe two things are ſo annexed one to the other, that whoſoeuer is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite againſt our reuerend Archpresbyter, muſt of force be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentlie oppoſite againſt vs. And therein will we <hi>gloriari in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino,</hi> if any be thought oppoſite to vs, who are oppoſite vnto him. Therefore (good Sir) there is nothing I more deſire, there is nothing can be more honorable &amp; profitable for your ſelfe, then that you vnite your ſelfe vnto him, whom God hath made your Superior: who like vnto him which is <hi>Princeps Paſtorum,</hi> is in this our particular church <hi>lapis qui factus eſt, non in offenſionem, ſed in caput anguli, qui me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium parietem maceriae ſoluat, qui faciat vtraque vnum:</hi> is the onely meanes to ioyne vs all together in perfit loue and vnion, which we had long ſince enioyed, if his authoritie had bin admitted, as at this preſent there is no hinderance at all of vnitie, but the refuſing of the ſame. So that wee finde true that which is moſt worthilie ſayd by Sainct Paule, <hi>Non tenens caput ex quo totum corpus per nexus &amp; coniunctiones ſubministratum &amp; constructum creſcit in aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Dei.</hi> And the cauſe of this refuſing the head he expreſſed before: <hi>frustra inflatus ſenſu carnis ſuae.</hi> With this head therefore muſt I hold, to him muſt I be vnited, to him muſt we cleaue. <hi>Qui ille con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iungitur meus eſt: qui cum illo non colligit ſpargit.</hi> And vnfaignedlie I affirme vnto you, that I continuallie pray in particular for your vnion vnto him, in reſpect of the loue I haue borne and do beare vnto you: which ſhall not decay, although you would with neuer ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:16974:134"/> of iudgements and opinions. And thus wiſhing you to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that which is moſt to the glorie of God and your owne ſoules health, I ceaſſe. 11. Nouember. 1598.</p>

                  <p>PEruſing your Letter, I find little to the purpoſe, wherein I intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your anſwere. My deſire was, to be aduertiſed of all ſuch wrongs, as either in your owne knowledge, or by auowable informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I had committed againſt the Societie: and you altogether lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this point, amplifie another matter. Neuertheleſſe, ſith you haue taken paines to write, what better pleaſed you then to ſatisfie my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, I ſhall not let for eauening your labour, to returne you alſo my opinion of that you haue written.</p>
                  <p>Touching my ſtrangeneſſe, I pray conſider, whether I can not with greater reaſon except the ſame againſt you, then you againſt me. For you know the way to me, I know not where to come to you: and while I did know, I was (as I verily thinke) oftner then ten times with you for your once being with me. Beſides, in my knowledge, there was neuer any cauſe offered, why you ſhould eſtrange your ſelfe, and moe then one giuen me, that might iuſtlie diſſwade my repaire to you, as namely, when out of good will vpon aduertiſement I told the elder Gentlewoman of the ſafe ſhipping of her maide-ſeruant, ſhe refuſed to take notice, making a like ſtrange of my ſpeeches, as if I had bin a perſon iuſtlie to be miſtruſted, or not to be truſted with ſo ſmall a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Againe, one of thoſe that belong vnto you, and who was very well and long weeting to my free acceſſe in former time vnto you, made pretie ſhifts in diſſembling the houſe and quarter where you abide. Both which in common reaſon, did, and muſt bid me doubt, leaſt wonted good will or truſt, or both, be decayed in you and in them towards me. If you ſhall ſay, that you haue ſent for me once or twiſe, my being in Phiſick at thoſe times (as the meſſenger could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme from his eye) ſufficiently excuſeth my faile: and verily ſince my better health, I haue ſeuerall times wiſhed for a guide to conduct me vnto you, ſo little I did affect to eſtrange my ſelfe, notwithſtanding the vtter ſhew, or counterpleadings of the aforeſayd diſcurteſies. Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> in his laſt ſpeech with me, ſayd, the Fathers of the Societie had many exceptions againſt me, which was one principall
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:16974:134"/> cauſe, why I wrote vnto you in the tenor I did, but now if ſtrangeneſſe be all, and the ſame no more deſeruingly obiected, I ſee well a little can ſoone and eaſily be made much againſt me.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>Loue inforceth you to pittie me for my hurtfull proceedings.</hi> Good ſir, in my iudgement you ſhould haue ſhewed as much loue, and certes, loue better qualited, if it had ſtood with your good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to haue forborne alike hardlie to miſ-cenſure my proceedings. I wote not of what hurt my proceedings may be made the occaſion, becauſe the frailtie of man may make what is perfit good, to ſerue to ſhadow that which is ill. But how my proceedings may be the cauſe of hurt, which requiring an intention, doth make them truly hurtfull, and ſo denominate: this I ſee not, becauſe I do not eſpye in my ſelfe any ſuch intent and meaning. And if you ſay my proceedings be of that qualitie in their nature, you ſay more then I hope you ſhall be able to proue, and vntill you proue them ſo, why may not my nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade as much as your yea, or more, in regard you cannot be ſo priuie to my actions, their circumſtances, and my intent, as my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such as ſinisterlie report of me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are</hi> (by the auowance of your own aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion) <hi>to giue account on what ground they vttered their reports.</hi> Father <hi>Iones</hi> reported &amp; affirmeth the ſame in his Letter to me, that I ſhould call your kind of gouerning the Engliſh Colledge in Rome <hi>a Mache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilian gouernment, or worſe.</hi> And when by letter I wiſhed him either to proue that I ſpake the words, or diſproue himſelf for doing me the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, he returned anſwere: <hi>if I did purge my ſelfe of Fiſhers confeſſion, I ſhould ſatisfie him.</hi> Verily as I wote not what the father meant by this kind of replie, ſo the probableſt meaning that may be directlie gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his words ſeemeth to be, that <hi>Fiſher</hi> hath appeached me of ſuch plentifull &amp; bad matter againſt your Societie, as vntill I cleare my ſelf thereof, the good man cannot hold himſelf ſatisfied, and in the <hi>interim</hi> my good name forſooth to be ſo deepely wounded, and publickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued, as licenſeth him to report as he did, or what he liſteth further of me. My requeſt is the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of your owne graunt, that he giue an account on what ground he vttered the report, &amp; if ſo any detractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be found in me, I yeeld my ſelf to fulleſt ſatisfaction: if in him, I dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d my right. And becauſe this ſore ſpreadeth in time like a canker by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, the ſooner ſatisfaction be made, the better. But here I cannot but greatlie meruaile, with what ſhew of charitable dealing Fa. <hi>Iones</hi> or any of the Societie can vpbraid me with <hi>Fiſhers</hi> confeſſion, whome your ſelues call (as I vnderſtand your letter) <hi>a malicicus ſlanderer, and an
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:16974:135"/> impudent libeller.</hi> If you ſay the man is ſithence altered, I hope you haue better proofe thereof, and I deſire to know it, then that ſpeaking to my reproofe, he muſt make no lye, and no fault at all to diuulge, or obiect the ſame againſt me: and in ſpeaking to yours, he muſt tell no truth, and a crime to repeate it, or once to thinke it of you. Your fortune is good, my fauour little; neuertheleſſe, if coniectures vpon likelihood of circumſtances may perſwade ought, they pleade for me againſt the aſſumption. For what can carrie more probabilitie, then that he, who being at libertie, free and out of feare, could and did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with his conſcience for ſlandering a meany, and ſuch a meany as your ſelues be, who haue ſo mightie partners euery where, would in his reſtraint, in the height of his diſtreſſes, and for ſooner ridding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of trouble, make ſcruple perdy, to wrong or calumniate ſuch a meane one as my ſelfe is, ſo farre off alſo, and without all acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in that place? Againe, whatſoeuer it be that he accuſeth me of, as what it is I cannot imagine, he muſt needes take the ſame from the mouth of another, or borrow it from his owne inuention: becauſe he neuer knew me, nor I him, or euer had conference each with other, by meſſenger, word, letter, or otherwiſe. Neuertheleſſe, ſith Fa. <hi>Iones</hi> layes his confeſſion to my charge in the diſcurteous manner he doth, I muſt needes thinke (or hold the Father very inconſiderate) that there is ſome ſurer proofe for the veritie of that I ſtand accuſed of, then the only preſumption of <hi>Fiſhers</hi> bare confeſſion. Or if there be not, as I requeſt all that may be brought, to be brought againſt me, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is very hard which is offered, in that his ſole word muſt be a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant truth againſt me, whome your ſelues condemne, and are bound thereunto, vnder loſſe of much credit, for a very vnhoneſt, malicious, and lying perſon.</p>
                  <p>You affirme, <hi>that his Holines of late hath ordained a certaine gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among vs, and that Maiſter Blackwell is our lawfull Superior made by God.</hi> Good ſir, if you loue not our errors, or more, if you loue peace,<note place="margin">Note theſe well.</note> proue your affirmations, and you end the difference. For vndoubtedlie our ſoules beare witneſſe that you are faultilie miſtaken, if you take vs for ſuch, that will neither obey what our holie Father the Pope ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth, or what God himſelfe ordaineth. Belieue me I beſeech you, that the reaſon why we delay in the manner we do, to ſubiect our ſelues to the new authoritie, is not becauſe <hi>we are in vaine puffed vp by the ſenſe of the fleſh,</hi> as you wrongfullie inſinuate: but becauſe we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee, nor can heare of any Bull, Breue, or other authenticall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:16974:135"/> comming from his Holines, for atteſtation and declaration thereof. Which forme of proceſſe, being euer the cuſtomarie vſe of the Sea Apoſtolicke, euen in matters of much leſſe moment, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parablie of leſſer queſtion, and failing in this, maketh vs greatlie to miſdoubt, or rather putteth vs in vndoubted aſſurance, that his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines was not the author thereof, nor the appointer.</p>
                  <p>His holie Fatherhood well knowes we haue no Church-liuings, but liue only of almes, and that our miſeries are in way of no other caſe, then the priſon, torture, and gallowes, euery miſcreant hauing ſufficient authoritie to apprehend vs: ſo that for his Holines to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of our preſſures, to make the burden of our croſſes more heauie, not only by denying vs the choice of our owne Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, (a freedome and benefite which the Cleargie euery where elſe, and by the Canons of holie Church enioyeth) but by impoſing alſo a Superior vpon vs, without all our vnderſtanding, and not with the leaſt notice of our liking ſeemeth to our iudgements to be a courſe of much greater ſeueritie, then the mildnes of his Holines nature, and the ripe wiſedome of his aged experience, would euer deſigne, and leſſe enact, and put in vre againſt vs. Further, his Holines being for theſe fortie yeares ſpace our immediate Biſhop, how can we, without expreſſe certificate of ſuch his Holines pleaſure, admit another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his bleſſed Fatherhood and vs, vnleſſe we would thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our ſelues of want of loue and dutie towards his Holines, and of forgetfulnes for ſeuerall rich benefits receiued. They be in <hi>England</hi> who haue heard his Holines to ſay, that he would not appoint a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in <hi>England</hi> before (to vſe his owne words) the good Prieſts there ſhould aduertiſe what kind of gouernment they thought fitteſt, and beſt liked. Therefore affirme what you liſt, and tell your fauorites, and the vulgar neuer ſo liberallie, and vntrulie to prattle of our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiued diſobedience, yet we may not beleeue the new authoritie to be the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that ſea, hauing (by the record of many) his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines owne words to the contrarie. There is an eſpeciall <hi>prouiſo</hi> in the Cardinals letter, that if it happen the Archpresbyter to dye, or be taken, then the next ſenior aſſiſtant to ſupply that roome, till there be another choſen by the Cardinall. Verily if we had no other ground at all, but the hardnes of this <hi>prouiſo,</hi> there were cauſe enough to aſſure our ſelues that his Holines had no part in the new authoritie. For who weeting to the abundance of his fatherlie loue, care, and mild procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, can winne his thoughts, or once to feare, that his wiſedome
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:16974:136"/> and rare clemencie, would alike grieuouſlie loade our miſeries with ſo perpetuall a burden, as neither firſt, nor laſt, nor at any time to haue the chooſing of our owne Superior, but muſt in all changes ſtand to the appointment of a ſtranger, vnacquainted with vs and our State, and who taketh wholie his aduertiſements or direction from others that are not of our companie, but incorporate to another body, and who more labour the glorie and aduancement of their owne pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar as reaſon leadeth, then the good of others, from whom they are by profeſſion diſtinguiſhed. Yea thoſe that are the Cardinals infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and whome his Grace moſt willinglie heareth and followeth, are the chiefe parties of the one ſide in the difference, for ouerruling whereof, the new authoritie was firſt thought on, ſollicited, and at vnawares brought vpon vs. Now the truth of the particular being thus, as euery one ſees who is acquainted with the iſſue of matters, and will not cloſe his eye, I appeale euen to the good opinion which your ſelfe holds of his holines diſpoſition, indifferencie, and iuſtice, whether if he had bin the inſtitutor of this new authoritie, his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and tender conſcience would haue permitted the adding of ſo large a prerogatiue, or truer of ſo vnequall a <hi>prouiſo.</hi> I thinke it an attribute of iuſtice, if not a decree in nature, that the bond of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ought euermore to bring ſome commoditie with it: as the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the ſeruant to his maiſter receiueth wages: the obedience of the child to his parent, the benefit of education: the obedience of the wife to her husband, her maintenance and dowrie: the obedience of the religious to his ſuperior, prouiſion of all neceſſaries: the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Prieſt to his Biſhop, iuriſdiction, and the appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: the obedience of the ſubiect to his Soueraigne, protection and the adminiſtration of iuſtice: and generally whereſoeuer obedience is due, there followeth a correlatiue, I meane a good depending which maketh it due. You would haue vs to obey, and it is the ſcope of all your trauailes. I praye name vs the good that commeth to vs thereby, the whole authoritie conſiſting only in the taking away of faculties, and in diſtreſſing more our miſeries? If the ſuppoſed autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie had bin the action of the Pope, no doubt his Holines conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for drawing mens obedience the ſooner thereunto, would haue giuen to it ſome indulgence at leaſt, if no temporall or other kind of ſpirituall commoditie. I ſhall be driuen to touch this point in mo pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, being the directing cliffe to all, and therefore do omit here to ſtay longer vpon it, hoping what is alreadie ſaid to be ſufficient.</p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:16974:136"/>
                  <p>You proceede to the reckning vp of our pretences, for ſo it phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieth your pen to by-name the reaſons following, as though all were falſe colours, and no truth at all: and thus you repeate them, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by vs.</p>
                  <p>1. It is a thing deuiſed by the Ieſuites.</p>
                  <p>I truſt you will not make ſhew to deny this, the truth being ſo cleare as the light of the Sunne when it ſhineth. And if you do, a number of conuincing teſtimonies can be brought againſt you, and you by gaineſaying ſo euident a truth, will giue vs good cauſe to take heede, how farre we beleeue you in doubtfull and vnknowne matters.</p>
                  <p>2. The Superior is one of the Ieſuites owne chooſing.</p>
                  <p>This alſo we auerre for a certaine truth, and auow further, that not only the Superior<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but all the aſſiſtants are likewiſe of your chooſing, as Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> himſelfe, neither could nor did deme, nor ſeemed vnwilling to acknowledge. And what greater ſoueraigntie would you ſeeke to carrie ouer vs, if you might haue your wiſhes, being in the dignitie of prieſthood, and in the labours for our countrie by many yeares our iuniors?</p>
                  <p>3. Why ſhould the Ieſuites appoint vs a Superior, more then we a Generall to them?</p>
                  <p>If the reſemblance be not good, I praye ſhew the difference that diſproueth, and the reaſons why you may elect our Superior, and we not yours.</p>
                  <p>4. It is the fine head of Father Parſons that hath inuented this.</p>
                  <p>Omit the epitheton, I meane ſo farre as it carrieth the nature of a quipping word, and the reſidue we maintaine, belieuing there is no one, who will not wilfully blind himſelfe, but ſeeth ſo much. For what can be clearer if particulars be compared, or what leſſe denyable or more manifeſt, then that whereof his owne letters to Maiſter Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Pearſe,</hi> to Maiſter Doctor <hi>Worthington,</hi> and others beare witnes infalliblie? Therefore good ſir, where you let not to affirme, <hi>that God hath made Maister Blackwell our Superior,</hi> you are to proue, prouing your aſſertion, that father <hi>Parſons</hi> act was Gods deede, and what the one, the other did, which will be ſomewhat hard for you to do, in reſpect of the indirect dealing which father <hi>Parſons</hi> vſed in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ouer word vnto vs, to deſiſt from further proceeding to the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:16974:137"/> chooſing of a Superior, as from a matter I wot not of what ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and he himſelfe notwithſtanding to labour and effect it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand, contrary to the purport of his meſſage and all our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. The Cardinall addreſſed a letter (as you know) to two reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Prieſts while they were on the way to <hi>England,</hi> and in it made ſpeciall mention of two apoſtolicall Breues, which his Holines had then newly ſet forth. The letter ſigned with his Graces ſeale, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with his owne hand, rehearſed the contents of both in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following: <hi>Sua Sanctitas Breue apoſtolicu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> edidit, Datum apud Sanctu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Marcum ſub anulo Piſcatoris, die decimo octauo huius menſis ſeptembris praeſentis anni 1597. quo prohibet omnino, ne quis Anglicanae nationis, quoad illud Regnum ad religionis Catholicae, ac ſedis Apostolicae vnionem redierit, Doctoratus gradum in theologia vel iure accipiat, niſi poſt curſum quatuor annorum expletum, alios adhuc quatuor annos ad ea quae didicit perpolienda impendat, neque tunc etiam niſi habeat ſuberioris Collegij in quo vltimò ſtuduerit licentiam in ſcriptis, cum Protectoris vel vices eius gerentis aſſenſu, &amp; qui ſecus fecerit, illum poenam excommunicationis ipſi ſedi Apostolicae reſeruatae ipſo facto incurrere: neque praeterea gradum, quem accepit vllum eſſe omnino ſed prorſus inualidum. Edidit praeterea</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This Breue was neuer ſeene, for ought we euer heard.</note> 
                     <hi>ſua Sanctitas aliud Breue exhortatorium, ac conſolatorium ad Catholicos Anglicanos pijſſimum illud quidem, ac verè Apostolicum, quo eos ad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiam patientiam, longanimitatem, coeteraſque virtutes hortatur praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pue vero concordiam, pacem, ac vnionem, quae coeterarum omnium virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum fundamenta ſunt atque vincula, eoſque vitent, qui ſeditiones, ac diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiones ſeminant.</hi> Good ſir, as I may be deceiued, ſo perhaps I am, yet vnder correction I muſt thinke that there may be framed out of theſe a <hi>dilemma,</hi> or forked argument, that maketh euery way greatly for vs. Either the reported Breues were ſet forth, or not ſet forth. If ſet forth, then what ſhould perſwade, that his Holines wiſedome and diligent regard, being alike circumſpect and prouident in making forth his particular and ſpeciall Briefes for ordering the precedents, would in enacting this new authoritie (a much more iealous and contentious ſubiect) forget, or neglect, or refuſe, to do the like or more? Shall we attribute to his ſacred fatherhood, prudence, vigilancie, and matureſt conſideration in ſmall matters, &amp; take them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Holines in great? His Holines poſſeſſeth the Chaire, that hath the promis of diuine aſſiſtance. He is our holie Father, and therefore retaineth care of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing peace among vs his children: as the dignitie requireth, ſo his Holines is full of charitie, benignitie, and compaſſion, and therefore
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:16974:137"/> much vnlike, eſpeciallie while the Magiſtrate is in drawing his ſword againſt vs, that his Holines would appoint a meere puniſhing autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, that neuer had an example, and not ſo much as ſignifie to vs the conſtitution thereof, by Bull, Briefe, or other Papall inſtrument, but as if our caſe, function and trauels were deſpiſeable to leaue vs to the reports of others for notice thereof: who, as to his Holines know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge deedes haue proued, incline more to fauour that is againſt vs, then to friend or cauſes. And to ſay, as ſome ſay, or as they ſay who ſay moſt, that his Holines wiſedome omitted to make forth a Briefe thereof, for feare of trouble, and prouoking the State, is ſo light and ſuperficiall a reaſon, as it beſt anſwereth it ſelfe in his owne weakenes. For what greater trouble could ſuch a Briefe cauſe, which the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new authoritie cauſeth not more? Neither do we demand the tranſporting of the Briefe, though we ſee no more danger therein then in ſending ouer the Cardinals letters, yea much leſſe, becauſe the pot that goeth often to the water, is likelier at length to returne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, then that which was vſed but once. The fauour and iuſtice we ſue for, is only canonicall notice of that which is done. For this we call, for this we haue long and often called, and for this ſhall we ſtill continue calling, being both iuſt and reaſonable, and the performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of no difficultie, nor requiring time, were the authoritie his Holines ordinance. On the other ſide, if no ſuch two Briefes were ſet forth (as I am ſure you will not grant) then muſt father <hi>Parſons</hi> the archdeuiſer thereof be much too blame in getting the Cardinals hand, ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſeale to the aforeſaid Letter, and iuſt cauſe adminiſtred, why we ſhould ſuſpect the like peece of cunning in other letters that haue come from the Cardinall. There is one clauſe chiefely in his Graces letter of the tenth of Nouember, which bearing little ſhew of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie, maketh vs the more to feare the like guile by father <hi>Parſons.</hi> For who euer heard, where there was but an outward face of iuſtice, that the Iudge ſhall commaund one aduerſarie, to informe him of the life and manners of the other aduerſarie, and to lay downe his cauſes and reaſons for him in the matter in queſtion betweene them? The partialitie appeareth ſuch, as deforceth vs to thinke that euer his Grace read the Letter, but ſigned it, vpon confidence of father <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> ſinceritie and wiſedome. A ſmooth meane to deceiue the beſt. You ſee good ſir, how either part of the propoſition (and one muſt needes be true) maketh in our excuſe, for not ſtooping downe our necks to the yoake that father <hi>Parſons</hi> hath prepared, and by all
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:16974:138"/> meanes laboureth to inforce. If Maiſter <hi>Standiſh</hi> be asked the cauſe of his iourney to <hi>Rome,</hi> the perſwaſions vſed to him to that end, the helps he receiued, the companions he went with his long expectance for father <hi>Parſons</hi> returne out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who brought him to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Holines, the particulars of the oration he made, of whom he receiued the inſtructions, his Holines ſpeeches in anſwere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, he can informe enough, if your owne acquaintance with the plotting and proceſſe of the matter be not light ſufficient, to teach you who inuented the new authoritie, who layd the ground, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the complements. I ſhould ſtay my pen from writing it, if it auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ought to be ſilent in that which euery man notes. It would make more to the praiſe of father <hi>Parſons,</hi> if being a religious man, he were either leſſe actiue, or buſied in matters directlier appertaining to his calling and charge. For what hath he to do with the Prieſts in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> How do we depend of him? At what back-dore vnknowne doth his authoritie or charge come in? Or what may the rich plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures be that his wit and trauels hath ſtead vs in, and bound vs to him, why he ſhould in this high preſume of our patience, and yeelding to whatſoeuer he liketh to appoint? Sundry of his deuiſes, or to returne the ſame word back againe that he giueth vs, diſturbances, haue ſo little made vs beholden vnto him, that neither we nor our Countrie haue receiued more preiudice from any that ſeemeth to loue vs. He happie, we happier, if religion were leſſe worldlified in him, and ſtate matter, and the deſigning of kingdomes had not ſo great a part in his ſtudies.</p>
                  <p>5. Father Parſons hath giuen wrong information to the Cardinall and his Holines.</p>
                  <p>So farre as the coniectures of all likelihood may auerre a troth, this is no vntruth, becauſe we can no way conceiue that the Cardinall or his Holines would euer haue decreed ſuch a penall forme of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conſiſting only in taking away of graces, without bringing the leaſt benefit to our countrie, or eaſe to our afflictions, if their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes had bin fullie and rightfullie informed of the true ſtate and termes of our aduerſities. That I ſay nothing of the deſignes and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions which many of the ancients in our realme had aſſigned, and were forthwith determined to exhibit them to his Holines view, iudgement, and approbation. Further, if father <hi>Parſons</hi> had giuen true information to the Cardinall and his Holines, it followeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:16974:138"/> that his credit is right litle or nought with either (which you would not haue vs to thinke) yea and their loues and care alſo (which we ſhall neuer thinke) as litle or leſſe towards the huge multitude of our manifold miſeries, in reaſon their ſupreame authoritie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion cannot be drawne to graunt vpon his information, and ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing no other fauour then increaſe of penalties, and facultie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke whatſoeuer our late Cardinall of bleſſed memorie had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the ſea Apoſtolick, as well to credit Prieſts the more, as alſo to manifeſt his greater affection towards our Countrie: yea, and as though this had bin too litle ſeueritie, to inflict beſides that kind of puniſhment, without annexing the ſame to any crime or crimes, as no age ſince the beginning of the world (as I verily aſſure my ſelf) yeelds in all reſpect a preſident. All which conſiderations commaund vs to belieue, that the Cardinall (eſpeciallie his holines) had no part in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe the particulars of the authoritie, or were not well infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but much more miſinformed by father <hi>Parſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. The Cardinall was alwayes partiall on the Ieſuits ſide.</p>
                  <p>I wote not into what hard meaning the word partiall may be drawne, therefore we only affirme, that his Grace is no way a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend to your Societie, but euery way moſt ready to do you all the pleaſures and the beſt furtherances he can.</p>
                  <p>7. Some of neceſſitie muſt be ſent to informe better.</p>
                  <p>I verily belieue the neceſſitie hereof, was many wayes ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantlie great, that vnleſſe our two brethren had out of their charitie and due conſiderations, aduentured vpon the difficulties of the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for learning the truth, and his Holines pleaſure in all things, there had bin much more alteration and queſtioning among vs about the validitie and bond of the authoritie, then now is, or hereafter can be, hauing by their labours made knowne our caſe, and ſubmiſſiuelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred our ſelues to his Holines arbitement in what ſoeuer. That the Cardinall by the title of his Protectorſhip, ſhould haue the like ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie in <hi>England,</hi> as to inforce a Superior vpon vs, manger our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnes, and without our priuitie, ſeemeth ſo ſtrange a noueltie, as the like was neuer heard of in our countrie before, nor as I thinke euer had inſtance in any other country hereticall or catholick. Or if his excellencie haue this ample iuriſdiction, by any other title, grace, or
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:16974:139"/> priuiledge, it were very meete we knew it, and after ſome authenticall manner, eſpecially ſith he delegateth authoritie, euen to take all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from vs, graunted by whome ſoeuer, or when ſoeuer: yea, to remoue vs from the places of our acquaintance and reſidence, and by conſequence to turne vs to ſeeke harbour and ſuſtenance among ſtrangers: an extremitie moſt ſeueare and moſt meruellous, the rigour of the lawes of our Realme, and the tearmes of the beſt condition that Prieſts liue in dulie conſidered, which is meane and baſe enough, without this new increaſe of our greater contempt and agrieuances.</p>
                  <p>8. The meſſengers muſt procure that ſome aſſistants be choſen, who may not be thought partiallie affected to the Ieſuits.</p>
                  <p>Sir, admit this were ſo, albeit I thinke there will be many other motions made before, yet what kind of iniuſtice, or vncharitable dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling can you deduce from hence? Is there not good cauſe that at leaſt ſome of the aſſiſtants (who haue by the veritie of Maiſter <hi>Blackwels</hi> words, euery one in his owne quarter, as large authoritie to execute all extremities as himſelfe againſt vs) ſhould be perfitlie vpright, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out poize of biaſe or parcialitie? And I praye what reaſon can you yeeld, or any other complice of the new authoritie, why the Prieſts themſelues of each quarter ſhould not be franchiſed and allowed ſo much fauour, as to chooſe the aſſiſtant that muſt be ouer them, vnleſſe we muſt be made yongmen ſtill, or rather boyes or children, and you our tutors to gouerne and direct vs in all things, and giue our voyces for vs?</p>

                  <p>You verily ſooth, <hi>that the ſucceſſe of matters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince the authoritie of the Reuerend Archpreſbyter was diuulged, doth make many to feare, leaſt the ſecret intention (yet not perceiued of all) of thoſe which were the principall ſeekers, to erect a ſodalitie, or other ſuperioritie and ſubordination, was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ambitious, or ſeditious.</hi> You ſtill make little conſcience to ſpeake your pleaſure of vs. Maiſter <hi>Standiſh</hi> was the firſt and principall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (as I haue bin told) of the ſodalitie, and who vnderſtanding that his parts were counted by vs not fit to beare office in the ſame, anon ſhifted ſayles (vpon what intent you may better aske him) and ſo lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs, went to you, became an agent, and by his induſtrie or good
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:16974:140"/> fortune, hath gotten an aſſiſtantſhip. If in the former charge you meane him, he is of age let him anſwere for himſelfe. But if by it you point to me, and others, then let vs ſee how you faſten the fault of ambition or ſedition vpon vs. You ſay becauſe <hi>hauing now that very thing which we ſought for, although impoſed vpon other perſons, do neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe reprehend and impugne the ſame.</hi> Like truth, like proofe. Is the new authoritie good ſir, that very thing we ſought for? I could wiſh that writing in a controuerſie, you would be better aduiſed what you did affirme, &amp; how you did contradict your ſelfe: for not ſeauen lines before, you called ours another gouernment from this, as indeede it is, and as different a gouernment, as chalke and cheeſe, white and blacke. For as chalke and cheeſe agree in whitenes, and white and black in that they are both colours: ſo this new authoritie with that we intend, agrees only in the name of a gouernment, and in all other points and properties, moſt diſcording and diſſonant, as is manifeſt by comparing them together. Ours conſtrained none to accept thereof: this inforceth all. Ours communicated benefits: this penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Ours was to be inſtituted by the good liking of all their conſents that were to obey: this enacted by whoſe meanes we know not, other then by the plotting of your Societie, vnwittingly to vs all. Ours a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie intreating: this full of commaunds. Ours neuer to haue proceeded, vnleſſe the following of peace had bin ſure by the opinion of all or the moſt and wiſeſt: this the more vnquietnes it moues, the greater variance it ſtirreth, the ſtifflier and with the more earneſtnes it is purſued againſt the refuſers. Ours brought in it ſelfe conſolations to our aflictions, reliefe to our needes, ſuccour to our diſtreſſes, ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall commodities to our countrie, ſpirituall and temporall, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing mutualitie of good offices; not only betweene vs, that were of that ſodalitie, but betweene vs and our other brethren, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Cleargie and the Laitie: this, I meane as it hath bin hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto practiſed, harroweth mens conſciences, bringeth Prieſts in contempt, maketh laymen our controllers, rayſeth ſlaunders, priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the toungs of your followers, preiudiceth our beſt friends, decayeth charitable almes, breedeth faction, and putteth diſlike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene perſons of neereſt aliance. And none of theſe heanie ſequeles counterpoyſed, by any ſpirituall good enſuing, either to vs, or our countrie thereby; nay both receiue detriment in this kind alſo, as the new authoritie is now and euermore may be demayned againſt vs; as namely, trouble, cumber, vexation of mind, ſcandall, and ſtumbling
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:16974:141"/> blocks, euen in the way of the good. Thus you ſee good ſir, how little in our account, the new authoritie is that very thing we ſought for. And admit it were the ſelfeſame with ours, as you affirme it to be, yet haue I to demaund of you, why fauouring the new authoritie with the maine force of all your endeuours, by prayſing, writing, ſubſcribing, counſelling, directing, ſoliciting, imployment of your friends, and what way ſoeuer you could, or can moſt grace, recommend, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the ſame, did ſo little countenance and ſet forward the aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we purpoſed, being as you will needes haue it, the ſelfeſame thing with the other: I ſay, did ſo little countenance and ſet it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as ſome of your brethren (what part ſoeuer your ſelfe had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in) ſpake liberally againſt it, diſpraiſed it, condemned it, gaineſtood it, and by cunning preuention ouerthrew it? Againe, if ours and this be all one, what may Maiſter <hi>Blackwels</hi> reaſons be, why he, hauing writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and to ſo great liking of himſelfe, againſt that which we purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, would or did accept of this with all readines and applauſe, being as you confidentlie affirme, the very thing which ours was, and which himſelfe before improued with many words? I will go further, and aske you that which is hardlier aſſoyled. What moued Maiſter <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> if this and ours be one, to diſcommend and glaunce ſo oft and pretilie as he hath done, both in ſpeech and writing at the one, and ſo exceeding highly commend and extoll the other? If he or you ſeeke to guild the matter, in reſpect, that this hath the ſtrength and louer of authoritie, which ours had not, the ſhadow which hereby you would ſeeme to lay on, is nothing, becauſe there is neither of you both, but well knew, that it was neuer our intention to haue the fellowſhip we ſolicited to proceede, be in force or in eſſe, before the Popes Holines had ratified and confirmed the particulars. And the motiue why we did acquaint the number of our brethren with the deſigne, before we ſought for confirmation thereof, from the chaire of his Holines, was not for an idle vaunt, or for an vntimely, or incongruent publication of our purpoſe (as Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> is ſtill pleaſed to hold the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) but for that we would not giue our brethren cauſe of offence, as iuſtlie we had done, by procuring the allowance, and eſtabliſhing of the aſſociation without their priuitie, aduiſe and agreement firſt had thereunto.</p>
                  <p>You demaund, <hi>what you haue done that all ſhould not affect you, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that if any affect you not, the fault is in them, and not in you.</hi> Good ſir, I know not your faults, or if I did, I ſhould refuſe to compoſe the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:16974:141"/> Letanie: yet do I not thinke, you beare that kind of hatred to your ſelues, as telling your owne tale, you would hurt your owne credits. There is no doubt but there are many that do not affect all your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, but where the blame reſteth hereof, that is the doubt: you lay it in vs, we returne it to you, and I beſeech the mercies of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, that we may euery one ſee his owne fault, agnize, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it.</p>
                  <p>You hold on, and make the degrees of affection which euery one beareth towards your Societie, a touchſtone as it were for trying who are fit, who vnfit to be Superiors. I will repeate your owne words as they lye together, to the end I be not thought to miſconſture, diſioynt or wrong place them. <hi>If they would haue themſelues or others that do not affect vs (though otherwiſe ſeeming neuer ſo vertuous) to be choſen heads: let them firſt affect vs (ſo farre as in vertue they ought) that they may be worthie of gouernment.</hi> The firſt parentheſis ſheweth nought that gliſtereth to be gold, vnleſſe it hath your opinion for foile. The reſidue layeth in, as it were a caueat, or rather giueth order, that ſuch as would be heads, muſt firſt affect you (<hi>ſo farre as in vertue they ought) that they may be worthie of gouernment.</hi> I muſt take leaue to aske you who ſhall iudge of this meaſure and qualitie of affection, which of like neceſſitie you require? Others or your ſelues? If others, who are they, and who made them the like officers? If your ſelues be the men, in what aſſurance can you put vs, that you will alwayes iudge aright? Forſooth the whiſperings of your owne thoughts, the conſtruction you ſhall be pleaſed to make of other mens words, deeds, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, ſhall be the aime, rule, compaſſe and light to direct you. And what may this be other then for your ſelues to beare rule, which if it be not your deſires ſo to do, truly there is an vntruth conceiued of you, and which hath many belieuers, and which in the contriuing, and managing of theſe latter actions, is no more hid, then what is moſt viſible. But I praye, what may the full meaning be of the condition you ſet downe, and which maketh thoſe only capable of ſuperioritie, or head-ſhip, that are qualited therewith? Do they <hi>only affect you ſo farre as in vertue they ought,</hi> that haue but one yea and one nay with you, and can diſlike nought, and will approue all, whatſoeuer you ſay or do, or go about? Or may they be ſaid to <hi>affect you ſo farre as in vertue they ought,</hi> who carrie a reuerent reſpect towards your Societie, and towards your perſons alſo, yet not ſo affectionatlie, but will ſee and can diſlike that is amiſſe in your actions, and be further willing, to put
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:16974:142"/> their moſt helpe to the redreſſe? No doubt if this meaſure be of the ſize that contenteth, there are as many or more fit, left vnchoſen as choſen, vpon ſuſpect and ielouſie only, that they affected you not, ſo farre as in vertue they ought. I haue little feare but that Maiſter <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> well cleared himſelfe of all ſuſpition that way, and <hi>affected you ſo farre as in vertue he ought,</hi> when in your behoofe, and not without preiudice to the ſchollers, he wrote a Letter to <hi>Rome,</hi> witneſſing vnder his hand, that there was no diſlike or difference betweene the fathers of the Societie, and the Prieſts in <hi>England,</hi> albeit your ſelfe with ſhew of griefe voluntarily acknowledged the contrary vnto me not long before; yea complained thereof, and expoſtulated the cauſes. He alſo <hi>affected you ſo farre as in vertue he ought,</hi> when for making vp the fuller meaſure of your purgation, letted not (as the report goeth) to touch three Prieſts at once with diſgrace, by writing vnder their teſtimonies and cenſure which they gaue, concerning the particulars of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall: <hi>Hij tres patres non bene informantur &amp;c.</hi> as if the three good Prieſts had bin altogether ſtrangers to the State and truth of matters, or carried ſo looſe conſciences, as in ſo waightie an affaire, would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme they knew not what, and to teſtifie vnder their hands what themſelues were ignorant of. Likewiſe that partie <hi>affected you ſo farre as in vertue he ought,</hi> who writing ſomewhat (as it was thought) with the largeſt in your and your brethrens behalfe, and being demaunded by a familiar friend of his, how he could verifie the words, anſwered, he could do it by the figure <hi>hyperbole.</hi> If ſuch dealing and exceſſe of truth be the meane of farming your good conceipts, I would be loath to become tenant, if I might haue, as this good man had, an aſſiſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for vantage. Others who ſpake and wrote their conſcience, and deliuered no more, then what their knowledge, iudgement, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie led them vnto, and that alſo vpon charitable conſiderations, and to good purpoſe, were notwithſtanding deemed thereby not <hi>to affect you ſo farre as in vertue they ought,</hi> and thereupon by the decree of your owne order, reputed not worthie of gouernment. The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is knowne, and after an vndenyable manner, as from his mouth, who carieth greateſt regard with you. By all that I haue ſaid, I would ſay, that this your ſtrange caueat or canon, and correſpondent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as well in appointing of our Superior, as in the choiſe of the aſſiſtants, and in the deuiſing of the inſtructions and forme of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhew apparantlie enough, how little you ſeeke to haue the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and ſwaying of all things.</p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:16974:142"/>
                  <p>You affirme, <hi>that in very deede, you would not haue any reprehended, becauſe they are oppoſite againſt you, but becauſe they acknowledge not their lawfull Superior.</hi> I praye ſir, how do theſe words comport with that you ſaid before, where you will haue the want of affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, a barre againſt election? Will you make men vneligible, without a fault, or without ſuch a fault as is worthie of reprehenſion? or will you haue ſuch faults as make men vneligible, to be ſoothed in them and not reprehended? One of theſe muſt needes follow, by the ſequele of your order: and either concludes more then my ſelfe ſees reaſon to maintaine. But let this be as it may be, aſſuredly all men are not perſwaded, and ſome do feele, and will ſweare, that not only the reprehending of your oppoſitors, but the puniſhing of them alſo, and with extreame rigour enough, ſetteth but as a gentle corraſiue to your hearts, howſoeuer you grieue now, and would haue that none be reprehended for being oppoſite againſt the Societie.</p>
                  <p>You giue vs to know, and ſeeme to take a liking therein, <hi>that you will by Gods grace, procure alwayes, and to your vttermoſt, that whoſoeuer is oppoſite againſt the reuerend Archpreſbyter, muſt of force be conſequentlie oppoſite againſt you &amp; your brethren.</hi> Howſoeuer you pleaſe your ſelf in the needleſſe vttering of theſe voluntarie ſpeeches, my dulnes cannot conceiue how this ſpirit agreeth with that of Saint Paule, <hi>factus ſum infirmus infirmis vt infirmos lucrifacerem,</hi> by compaſſion of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of all ſorts I became weake to the weake, that I might gaine the weake. If it be a fault to oppoſe our ſelues in the manner we do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the new authoritie challenged (as we acquiet our conſcience to the contrarie, and thinke our ſelues well able by ſound and good arguments to vphold the lawfulnes thereof againſt whome ſoeuer in our countrie) yet your Societie being no partie, nor bound to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medle, more indifferencie, and leſſe taking againſt vs, had beene in my poore opinion, as charitable and more wiſdome. For by making your ſelues a partie without cauſe, and ſo profeſſed and forward a partie, what could you get but aduerſaries, and haue debarred your ſelues from being mediators in the difference, <hi>ſi fieri poteſt, quod ex vobis eſt, cum omnibus hominibus pacem habentes,</hi> if it may be, as much as in you, hauing peace with all men.</p>
                  <p>That you ſay <hi>you will gloriari in Domino, if any be thought oppoſit to your Societie, who are oppoſite to our reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Archpreſbyter:</hi> I ſay no more, but hope, that notwithſtanding your <hi>gloriari in Domino,</hi> your glorie in our Lord, yet our Lord wil not be in this, <hi>gloria veſtra nec exalta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s caput ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum,</hi>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:16974:143"/> your glorie, nor the lifter vp of your head.</p>
                  <p>You auouch, <hi>that the new authoritie is the only meanes to ioyne vs all together in perfit loue and vnion, and that there is now no hinderance at all of vnitie, but the not admitting and refuſing of the ſame.</hi> Sir, I can eaſily belieue you in this, for God forbid I ſhould liue the while, to account you, or any of you, ſo ouerloaden with frailties, or ſurcharged with ill nature, that hauing your deſire, will refuſe to contract loue and vnion with thoſe that graunted it vnto you, and further, ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to your diſpoſing.</p>
                  <p>That which followeth in the ſame paragraffe maketh me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to muſe, by whoſe authoritie or example, you applie the words of Saint Paule, <hi>non tenens caput,</hi> not holding the head, to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presbyter. For if the holie Fathers of Chriſtes Church, and the Popes themſelues, other then in a generall terme, euer abſtained for reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Apoſtles, from vſing their kind of bleſſing and ſalutation, <hi>gratia &amp; pax à Deo Patre &amp; Domino nostro Ieſu Christo,</hi> grace and peace fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God our Father, and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, I ſee not why you might not very well for reuerence ſake, haue forborne the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that paſſage to Maiſter <hi>Blackwell,</hi> being literallie and euer principallie referred to our Sauiour, and neuer ſecondarilie applied to any but a Pope, nor can be but incongruouſly, as my ſmall reading and iudgement giueth me. A bold charge, hard meaſure, that, for bearing off to ſubiect our ſelues to the new authoritie, vntill the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of our two brethren with true certificate of his Holines plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure therein, we muſt be counted by you, <hi>non tenere caput ex quo totum corpus per nexus &amp; coniunctiones ſubministratu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; constructum creſcit in augmentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Dei,</hi> not holding the head, wherof the whole body by ioints and bands being ſerued and compacted, groweth to the increaſe of God: which is by the prime and proper ſignification of the place, to apoſtatate or forſake Chriſt, and in the ſecond and largeſt ſenſe, to be an hereticke or ſchiſmaticke. Take heed good ſir, leaſt for reprouing others, you vtter what is not worthie of your ſelf. I know you had not<note place="margin">The inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſhewed I was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued herein.</note> ſo ill a meaning, but the inferences be direct, and therefore I wiſh you againe to take better heede to the running of your pen hereafter.</p>
                  <p>You ſay, <hi>the new authoritie is receiued with ſingular liking of the moſt and beſt, and that who is ioyned to Maiſter Blackwell is yours,</hi> and <hi>qui cum illo non colligit ſpargit,</hi> he that doth not gather with him ſcattereth. Firſt, you forget compariſons to be odious, and continue the citing of places vnprouable againſt vs. Then you ſooth more then can be
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:16974:143"/> truly auerred in the eye of the world: for by generall opinion, there are of as good parts, and of as good deſerts, and of no leſſe name, that haue not, as haue ſubmitted themſelues thereunto. And for the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (a gay coate-card in all your mouthes) I thinke if there were au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from the ſea Apoſtolicke, willing euery Prieſt to deliuer his conſcience which of the two kinds of gouernment he moſt liked, or deemed fitteſt, either this of your and father <hi>Parſons</hi> deuiſing, where an Archpresbyter, the loweſt Prelature in holie Church, and now<note place="margin">And this time the Laitie were not compriſed vnder the authoritie.</note> worne out of vſe, muſt abſolutely commaund and preſcribe to the Cleargie of a whole kingdome: or the other that we now principallie ſue for, which is the Eccleſiaſticall &amp; only vſuall regiment throughout all Chriſtendome: I ſay, if there were ſuch authoritie graunted, for comming to the true knowledge of euery prieſts opinion herein, there would be, as I am moſt aſſured vpon good grounds, ten for one, if not twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie, or rather hundreds of the Cleargy &amp; Laity with vs againſt you.</p>
                  <p>Now ſir for concluſion, if the points of your Letter to me, or more, if the contents of your Letters to others, whereof I haue had ſome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: or more then either, if the ſeueritie vſed in <hi>Rome</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> againſt our cauſe and brethren, were vprightlie and iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie weighed, doubtles in my opinion there would appeare little ground for the truth of that you ſay in the beginning of your Letter, to wit, <hi>that if all could not be induced to loue and affect you, you would yet beare their auerſion with patience and ſilence, without following any courſe or purſute againſt them.</hi> I praye, if the Societie, I meane the Engliſh and your adherents, ſhould do their worſt, what could there be more done then is done againſt vs? Could there be more horrible crimes obiected? Could what is obiected be more openly or more againſt conſcience diuulged? Could promiſes be leſſe kept? Could conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be worſe performed? Could diſſimulation be finelier masked? Could Prieſts ſuſtaine greater triall of patience, then is heaped on them? Could the burden of their afflictions take increaſe? Could their friends be more earneſtlie laboured to withdraw their good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and charities from them? Could there be mightier ſhoouing, to remoue ſome of that coate from their places of reſidence? Could all aſſayes, almoſt euery way, to that end be leſſe forborne? Could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction be rifer? Could calumniators ſwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ue more? Could mo prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers be found to teniſe their obloquies? Could harder cenſures be giuen of them or more liberallie? Could their liues be ript vp from a further period? Could their faults be liuelier depainted? Nay, could
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:16974:144"/> faults of no faults be plentifullier created? Or could all this, or more, go freer without ſatisfaction, leſſe check, rebuke, or controulement? Lamentable, that men ſuffering for being Prieſts, and ſuffering the like extremities they do, ſhould be deuoyded of faculties, and haue doubts thruſt into their heads, and by parties of ſpeciall name, to be alſo vnlawfull for them either to vſe the altar, or to practiſe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. So that if particulars be belieued, ſmall is the patience, leſſe the ſilence, and ſharp is the courſe or purſute that is followed againſt vs. I write not theſe things to the end I do or would charge any in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and much leſſe you, then any other: whome my loue hath a long while reuerenced for vertue, and other good habilities: but I rehearſe them (and verily with teares) to moue pitie, to ſtir vp compaſſion, and if I might be ſo happie, to procure alſo the ſurceaſing and redreſſe of theſe our common, but no common miſeries. And one thing ſeemeth more ſtrange then all, that acquainting as we did M. <hi>Blackwell</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with our purpoſe of ſending to <hi>Rome</hi> for full vnderſtanding of his Holines mind, and to intimate to his wiſedome the true ſtate of our countrie, and the tearmes of Prieſts, as his holie Fatherhood (by the relation of thoſe that heard the ſpeeches) required vs to do, yea ſome hauing made their appeale alſo from him, yet that in this ſhort <hi>interim</hi> till our iuſt doubts be cleared, neither he, nor your ſocietie, nor your copartioners, can be intreated to breath, and let the difference ſleepe, till our brethren bring, or your ſelues ſhew his Holines reſolution, but will needs with tooth and nayle, and with all earneſtnes purſue the challenged authoritie againſt vs, and ſtop at nothing that lieth in your way, be it the generall diſturbance of vs all, and the diſquieting of the whole realme, that I ſay nothing of the ſcandall nor of the edging of other perſons. A better temper would more commend. Vndoubtedly, if our two friends returne not the ſooner, nor you perſwaded to deſiſt from the buſie courſe begun, aſſure your ſelues you wil baile our pens, and inforce vs for defending of our good names, to make knowne to the whole realme, the full ſtate &amp; proceſſe of all matters in <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; in <hi>England.</hi> Wherein, if there fall out ought, as it is feared there will fall out much, little to the commendation of ſome of your proceedings, you are to impute the blame to your ſelues, that thus mainely vrge the occaſion. Good counſell to remember before hand, that had I wiſt is too late. Neither were it amiſſe if you did leſſe follow the begging of names to <hi>Olim dicebamur,</hi> eſpecially with leſſe importunitie; an office fulleſt of ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for you to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you: but all ſhews fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the

For taking my leaue, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to conſider the diſſention at <hi>Rome,</hi> to conſider the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces in <hi>England,</hi> to looke into the cauſes &amp; maintenance of them both, and if you do not eſpy that we haue more to ſay againſt you, then you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, yet to thinke that our purgation when it commeth forth, wil ſhew you ſo much, &amp; proue vs alſo to haue vſed more plaineneſſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, truth, ſilence and charitie, then our oppoſitors haue done in their cariages againſt vs. Thus haue I (beloued ſir) tyred my ſelfe, and long troubled you, beſeeching you humblie of pardon, if I haue any way offended: and truly, if I knew the word, line, ſentence, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar which were againſt bounden charity, I could labour rather to blot it out with teares of bloud, then euer ſuffer it to come to reading.

Would God therefore it might pleaſe you (deere ſir) for perfit tryall of the truth, &amp; the thorow ending of the controuerſie, to licence, that we may conferre, reaſon, or diſpute the caſe with the conditions vnder ſpecified. Good manners, and more, the duties of obedience, forbid vs to name, or requeſt you to be one of the diſputants, being our Superior, but if your owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſhall carrie you to the yeelding of your moſt help, for better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and ſtrengthening of the iſſue, we ſhall hartilie greete the fauour, and reſt fuller ſatisfied, in reſpect we wiſh the vttermoſt that can be ſaid and vrged againſt vs. For certes, if we ſee our ſelues, we do neither affect to be miſled by errour, or dwell in ignorance, or, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing that we are deceiued, ſeeke for ought more, then to haue the noted crime, fortified with the proofes that may moſt reproue and conuict our guiltines. Among all the meanes our poore wits could thinke of, this appeared of moſt force and the readieſt, as well to let
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:16974:147"/> the miſtaken ſee their faile, as alſo to mediate a generall attonement, in regard the rules of conſcience bind to acknowledge a truth when it is euidentlie ſhewed, and the agnizing induceth to ſatisfaction, and ſatisfaction hath right and authoritie, as well to cancell iniuries paſt, as alſo to inuite loue for the time to come. Two ſoueraigne effects, and being the natiue begetters and nourcers of peace, cannot but bring great ioy and edification to many. If therefore your better iudgement ſhall like to ratifie this courſe, and vouchſafe to giue vs notice, the aduertiſement will much glad vs, and ſhall indebt vs for dutifull thanks to your Reuerence for the kindnes. Neither without good cauſe: for if the difference be not after this way decided, alas we ſee no remedie, but of conſtraint our good names bleeding alike pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifullie as they do, and the wound ſo oft and hardlie rubbed on as it is, we muſt either wittinglie ſuffer perpetuall infamie to come vpon vs, or take our pennes in hand, &amp; cleere our ſelues as we may. A proceſſe that feareth, becauſe great likelihood our apologie ſhall receiue an anſwere, the anſwere require a reply, the reply occaſion a reioynder, and ſo the difference become a circle, that is to ſay, without end, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe<note place="margin">How neere is this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction true.</note> it be that lamentable end which the Apoſtle ſpecifying, ſayd, <hi>quod ſi inuicem mordetis &amp; comeditis videte ne ab inuicem conſumamini,</hi> if ye bite and deuoure one another, take heed leaſt ye be not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med one of another.

                  <p n="3">3 Againe, there is a Letter auowed to be written by your Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, as the tenor can agree to no other, and the copies common, wherein the words following lye word for word, without change or interpoſition. <hi>We haue receiued a reſolution from our mother citie, that the refuſers of the appointed authoritie were ſchiſmaticks: and ſurely I would not giue abſolution to any that ſhould make no conſcience thereof. Do they thinke that the ſcandall that did ariſe thereof, that the diſcrediting of our Protectors authoritie, that the opprobrious ſpeeches againſt the Fathers vttered by them, that the danger they drue me vnto, may be free from ſinne? I hope they haue not ſo ſenſeleſſe a conſcience. And therefore my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is, that they do make accompt thereof, and do make ſatisfaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do receiue the benefit of abſolution. The order and manner of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I referre vnto the diſcretion of their ghostlie fathers which haue not bin marked with this note of ſchiſme.</hi> O good Lord help vs, is our demaund &amp; ſtanding off, only for canonicall proofe, that the deſigned authoritie was the ordinance of his Holines, or that it had his Holines approbation adiudged to make vs ſchiſmaticks, and the maieſtie of the place remembred to credit our dome the more? And hereupon, as if all were by and by an vndoubted truth, whatſoeuer is aduertiſed by ſome perſons againſt vs, you, firſt ſoothing what you would do your ſelfe, commaund all other, that we make ſatisfaction, ere the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of abſolution be imparted vnto vs. An ordinance only, and that ſeldome, annexed to publick and horrible crimes: but patience muſt be our remedie, &amp; much patience ſeemeth not vnneedfull, albeit our hope is, there may be ſome as meane ſchollers in <hi>Rome,</hi> as there are
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:16974:149"/> elſewhere, or how ſingularlie learned ſoeuer he or they were, that thus hardlie concluded, it inferreth not much, becauſe as the euidence and information were deliuered, ſo without all doubt were we ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced: and if theſe were either not true or vnperfit, as we aſſure our ſelues of the one or both, then muſt the iudgement depending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on needes take the ſame dye, &amp; be of like veritie. And if it be replied, that true and full information was giuen, then we aske, why it is not added to the reſolution, or otherwiſe ſhewed vnto vs, to the end our ſelues and others may be witneſſes thereof, and haue whereupon we may iuſtlie alter and repent our contrarie opinion? Beſides, it were to good purpoſe, and to our ſeeming not vnrequiſite, that as well the names of the reſoluers, as alſo the moſt ſubſtantiall reaſons of ſuch their opinion, were likewiſe ſet downe, and adioyned to the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For without theſe or other good ſpecialties, what man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of conſcience in the world, vpon view or heareſay of an vnau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thored reſolution, without ſhew of proofe, reaſon, inſtance, example, or authoritie, will condemne ſo many as are of our ſide of ſo irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a crime, and criminall outrage, whoſe proper entitie and nature requireth in the doer wittingnes, deliberation, obſtinacie, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and that immediatlie or mediatlie, againſt our high <hi>Pontifex,</hi> and as <hi>Pontifex</hi> or head of our Church: for vpholding and maintenance of whoſe prerogatiues, we haue ſuffered, and dayly do, many ſorts of preſſures, calamities, and death it ſelfe. A ſtrange propoſition, and much incredible. In like manner how is it poſſible, that ſuch a bare and naked reſolution ſhould weigh ought with vs, ſtanding as we are verily perſwaded we do, vpon diuerſitie of aſſured grounds for the contrarie, eſpeciallie when we conſider, who wrote the reſolution ouer, a puney in Religion, and fellow Ieſuite with the creatours of our ſchiſme: at what time? when a feare was conceiued, leaſt we had ſent to the Sorboniſts for their opinion: why? becauſe the vſuall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſer either had not (as may be coniectured) or would not be ſeene to haue his finger in ſo great an vnright, condemned ere we were heard to ſpeake, or asked the reaſons why we did prolong our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. To draw neerer, would not the ods in the iudgement of all men good ſir, fall on our ſide, if to counteruaile this vnſtrengthened reſolution, we ſhould oppoſe the opinion &amp; cenſures of our engliſh Students and Doctors at <hi>Doway,</hi> who (as an honeſt Prieſt reported<note place="margin">Maiſter Beiſley.</note> that came from thence) make the diſcourſe and proofe of our ſchiſme, a meere ieſt and matter of recreation, to ſport themſelues with by the

Or, if we ſhould ſeeke to incounter the ſaid reſolution by the ſuffrage euen of ſuch our fellow Prieſts here at home, as <hi>haue not bin marked with this note of ſchiſme,</hi> who being eye and eare witneſſes to all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and not without ſome knowledge in the ſtate of moſt of our ſoules, and therefore by probabilitie, as likely to ſee as farre into the point, as ſtrangers, were we anon caſt in the cloſing, or ſhould we leeſe thereby? If reports be true, or many of good vnderſtanding not deceiued, there are few of our ſaid brethren either reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for yeares, or ſpeciallie counted of for learning, vertue, wiſedome, iudgement, diſcretion, true courage in Gods cauſe, or for any other good part, who do not greatlie meruaile at this ſtrange reſolution, and not a little grieue to ſee and heare, how ſharplie, how vncharitablie, how iniuſtlie, we are dealt with, and what bond of endleſſe diſcord the pamphlet of ſchiſme (the occaſion and origin of all) hath moſt vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatelie caſt among vs, which notwithſtanding we do not rehearſe, that when the difference commeth to tryall, we intend to make be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of ſuch their opinions, hoping without that help, to be able with ſounder proofes to confirme what we hold, then with ſuch allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now touching your Fatherhoods charge, and our culpablenes in the other offences ſpecified, we omit to ſay much, partlie, in regard of dutie, partlie becauſe we would not be thought tender in taking, nor full of defending, partlie alſo, for <hi>that the raiſing of ſcandall,</hi> muſt fall in fine to their part, to whome the lawfulnes or vnlawfulnes of the vſed proceſſe, and more the truth or vntruth of our ſchiſme after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding, ſhall preſcribe and giue it.

Is it poſſible, we meane<note place="margin">Father Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets words in his letter to me of the 7. of March. 1599.</note> not for religious humilitie, or morall courteſie, but for gaule it ſelfe, or a worſe humour, to exaggerate matters heauier vpon vs, then to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, <hi>that if thoſe whome we haue begotten to Chriſt, or who are our ghostlie children, ſhould receiue ſacraments at our hands, they ſeeme to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue poyſon in place of medicine from vs, yea alſo to commit grieuous ſinne if they do but intreate vs to celebrate, or ſhall but help vs at Maſſe.</hi> Surely, ſurely, had we defiled our pennes againſt the Fathers with like ſtuffe and doctrine (Lord) how francklie had we bin exclaimed againſt with open mouth, if not all the bels both in towne and country rung out <hi>Crucifige</hi> vpon vs long ſince, to our euerlaſting ignominie? But the abhomination and execration of our ſchiſme commerited and importuned this, and a fuller meaſure of bitternes to be powred vpon vs. Be it ſo, though we hope by all authorities to cleere our ſelues from any ſuch tainder: yet the ſame being neither decided by ſentence of holie Church, nor in talke nor in the leaſt ſuſpition, before it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Fathers to raiſe and ſpread the calumniation of vs, we cannot but thinke we haue reaſon, to blame them of courſe and homely dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that hauing alwayes honored them in the degree we haue, and they being neither our ſuperior, againſt whome our offence, if any were, was committed, nor in any way with vs in ſubordination vnto him, but a diſtinct body from him and vs, thus peremptorily, thus ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly, thus violently to cenſure and condemne their long welwillers, and ioint-labourers with them in one vineyard. To ſay charitie indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to ſo exceeding a proceſſe againſt vs, were to ſpeake volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarilie beyond all likelihood of truth: for, if charitie had bin the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, charitie being as the Apoſtle writeth, <hi>patient, benigne, not prouoked to anger ſuffering all things, hoping all things, bearing all things,</hi> they would either haue deferred the denouncing of their cruell ſentence vpon vs, knowing that we had long before that time ſent to his Holines for

                  <p n="4">4 There remaineth one materiall point yet vnremembred, and which putteth vs in feare ofmo troubles at hand, <hi>viz.</hi> that part of your letter to Maiſter <hi>Clearke,</hi> wherein you ſignifie, that <hi>you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for the time to ſuffer vs in our opinion of ſchiſme, as the leſſe euill, and will not deale as yet as a prelate may do for appeaſing the ſame.</hi> What courſe you intend againſt vs good ſir in theſe your words, we know not in particular, but a warning they muſt needes be vnto vs, either to addreſſe our ſelues, to take vpon vs without demerit, the turpitude of ſchiſme, and thereby diſcredit our nation, ſtaine our function, leeſe our faculties, loade our conſciences, wrap our ſelues in cenſures, and turmoile, if not agonize, the ſoules of our ghoſtlie children, in bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding doubts, whether their confeſſions made vnto vs, or hereafter to be made, be good or no. On theſe miſchiefes, great, and many, and very fearefull, we muſt wittinglie put our ſelues as is ſaid, or prepare our patience to beare, whatſoeuer it ſhall like our hard friends to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and your ſelfe to impoſe vpon vs. Lamentable to remember how much the former glorie and renowne of our engliſh ſchollers and prieſts at <hi>Rome,</hi> are ſithence the death of our bleſſed Cardinall, eclipſed, or rather blotted, or rather then either, if we may ſo ſay, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed. Which euill hitherto outlandiſh and confined chiefely to that place, begins now alas to creepe hitherward apace, nay hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, found large welcome in our realme, and gauled the reputation of Prieſts, impeached the increaſe of Catholicks, decayed the reliefe of priſoners, and rayſed the like mutinies and debates in our country, as the generall and Gods cauſe lyeth groueling, amitie pineth, peace droopeth, our aduerſaries reioyce, and diſſention and faction ſeeme only to raigne. Our good Lord for the infinitenes of his mercy, guide and graunt you good Father, the happines to reforme all, and pardon the cauſers whoſoeuer they be, that they feele not the ſmart of the miſdeede, in the reckoning of their laſt accompts. For concluſion, we appeale honored ſir, to the indifferencie of your owne thoughts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (theſe, and mo of like agreiuance, which if we would, we could alleage, being the aduerſities of our preſent ſtate) there be not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt neceſſitie of mouing and recommending this ſute vnto you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting the graunt thereof, as we do, the ableſt meane of acquieting

                  <p>To take our leaues, we beſeech you on our knees of pardon, louing Father, if error in our vnderſtanding hath miſguided our pen in ought: for as for our will, we do aſſure ſhe is not acceſſarie, &amp; we hope we carry the minde, what decay ſoeuer other of late may note in vs, that we would not wittinglie do the thing, which our vnderſtanding ſhall giue vs to be vnlawfull. We miſdoubted the direct and lawfull procurement of the authoritie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more then pregnant coniectures: we did morallie aſſure our ſelues, that it was not the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Holines: we eftſoone to our great charge, ſent two of our brethren to <hi>Rome,</hi> for vnderſtanding the full truth therein: we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted your Reuerence with our intent: we gaue you a copie of ſuch things, as we purpoſed to moue to his Holines: we offered to obey you in the meane time, and did in fact obey you, as by ſeuerall particulars we can prooue, though we deferred to ſubiect our ſelues abſolutely vnto you before receipt of notice from our brethren or other canonicall certeintie, that the authoritie was the ordinance of his Holines. When the Breue came, we by and by without any delay, ſubmitted our ſelues, laboured our friends to do the like, ſhewed our ſelues ready to any ſeruice, and hauing bin almoſt infinitely wronged, as the particulars before touched do in part declare, neuertheleſſe for peace ſake, and to make vp vnion againe, we were content and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to remit and forgiue all that was paſt.

                  <p>It hath bin proued once or twiſe before, that the prorogation of<note place="margin">Pag. 85. 86. &amp; 238.</note> yeelding our obedience to <hi>M.

We of purpoſe omit here to refute the vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of the imputation, becauſe his Holines himſelfe hath giuen ſentence againſt the ſame, and not only cleered our delay from the accuſation of ſchiſme and enormious diſobedience, but from all kind of diſobedience. And verily we cannot but greatly maruell, how poſſibly ſo many of our aduerſaries, carying the reputation of learning and iudgement, could conſpire in ſo great an error, vnleſſe the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God thought it fit for ſome cauſe to humble them, or check the high opinion which many carry of their worthes, to the diſgrace, if not to the contempt of others their fellow-laborers, and perchance of equall deſerts with them, in the worke they iointly haue in hand. Obſtinate diſobedience (and without <note n="i" place="margin">D. Tho. 22. q. 39. art. 1.</note> obſtinacie, there can be no ſchiſme) may be conſidered three manner of wayes, either againſt the thing commaunded, or the perſon commaunding, or againſt the office of the commaunder, in not recogniſing him for his Superiour.

                        <p>VEry reuerend Fathers and brothers in Chriſt, we haue exhibited to the right noble Cardinals <hi>Burgeſius,</hi> and <hi>Aragone,</hi> (whom his Holines hath appointed for arbitrators in our cauſe, men renowmed for their knowledge in the lawes, and experience in all occurrences, and gratefull vnto all men for their ſinceritie) the reaſons whereby we were induced to deferre our obedience to the Arch-prieſt before the receipt and comming of the Apoſtolicall Breue. Which being ſignified vnto his Holines vpon the 11. of April, it pleaſed the right worthy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cardinals to ſignifie vnto vs his Highnes mind the ſame day, namely, that in regard of that our foreſayd delay, we were neither ſchiſmatiques, nor rebels, or diſobedient, and that thoſe confeſſions which were made vnto ſuch prieſts, who for theſe reaſons deferred their obedience, were in full force, and ought in no ſort to be reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, except perhaps ſome other cauſe or let did happen, then that which tooke his originall from the former dilation. Theſe things we haue therefore thought good to ſignifie vnto you, partly that many conſciences might be thereby ſatisfied, partly alſo that we might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite you vnto all modeſtie, charitie, and humilitie, as well in writing, as in example. The concluſion is, we haue a moſt pious and mercifull Father, and a moſt iuſt Iudge, neither haue we any cauſe to ſuſpect, but that very ſhortly we ſhall recouer our auncient peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilitie. <hi>Rome</hi> the 15. of April. 1602. Your Reuerences brethren and humble ſeruants in Chriſt,</p>

                  <p>A copie of theſe Letters was left by vs with both the Cardinals, who communicating the contents thereof to his Holines, receiued anſwere that his Holines willed and commaunded to write theſe vnto you.</p>
                  <p>We hope none will thinke that either our brethren in <hi>Rome</hi> whoſe names are ſubſcribed, or our ſelues would deuiſe or faine ſuch a letter: and the ſame being taken to be a true letter, we haue a great hope, that our aduerſaries will now change their opinion, and from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth call vs no more <hi>the contentious Prieſts,</hi> becauſe <note n="a" place="margin">D.

                  <p>Likewiſe the aduerſe part obiecteth ſcandall vnto vs, but with leſſe colour of pretence, then it imputeth contention. For he that can be ſayd to ſcandalize, muſt haue (as <note n="d" place="margin">22. q. 34. art. 1. ad. 4. &amp; art. 3.

Touching the firſt member of the diuiſion, we are ſure our aduerſaries will not ſay, that we had in our deferring a formall intention to ſcandalize: and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſecond member, it appeareth that our ſayd deferring was not of his owne nature induciue to ſinne, becauſe the ſame was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then what the Canons commaund, or allow, as the former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haue ſhewed, and as his Holines by his late declaration hath made more manifeſt. It reſteth therefore, that if our ſayd deferring occaſioned ſcandall, that is the ſpirituall ruine of others, it was meerely through the ignorance, or infirmitie, or the malice of ſuch as tooke ſcandall thereat. And before this actiue ſcandall by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent can be imputed a ſinne to the giuer, it is of neceſſitie (as all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines agree, and common reaſon telleth, for auoyding many groſſe abſurdities which otherwiſe would follow) that he <note n="e" place="margin">Valentia vbi ſupra puncto 2. &amp; 4.</note> who this
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:16974:157"/> way is ſcandalized, muſt firſt note, or be bound to note, both that another will take ſcandall at ſuch his fact, and that himſelfe be bound to deſiſt vpon the ſame notice, or aduerſion. Which two points and circumſtances our aduerſaries will neuer be able to proue to haue concurred in the act of our deferring. But of the other ſide, we little doubt, but that the condemnation which they paſſed vpon vs for the ſayd delay, and the great ſtirres, which by the nature of ſuch their actions haue followed, haue occaſioned both many, and moſt lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſcandals.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the ambition wherewith ſome of vs goe charged by our aduerſaries, we would know whether they accoumpt vs voyde of all iudgement: for if they do not, how can they report vs to be ambitious, when there is not ſcarce any one of meaneſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in our country, but knoweth, that no Engliſhman ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Cleargie or Laitie, can come to preferment in <hi>Rome, Spaine, Flanders,</hi> or any place where the Ieſuites liue, but only or chiefely by their mediation or countenance? Yea, what Prieſt in <hi>England</hi> can come into credit with the Arch-prieſt, or hold ſo much of his fauour as he poſſeſſed before, if the Ieſuites do not like well thereof? Alſo touching the future, none can be ſo blinde, as not to ſee, that the Ieſuites affect, and hope to haue the diſtributing of promotions, and the ruling of all things, if our countrie happen to turne Catholicke. Of which hope and deſigne of theirs, though there be many other ſtrong preſumptions, yet none ſeeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the ſame ſo apparantlie, as doth Father <hi>Parſons</hi> Babell, that is, his Caſtle in the ayre, or booke of Reformation, preſcribing rules to all eſtates. So that our aduerſaries knowing vs voluntarily to haue diſcontinued familiaritie with the Ieſuites, and broken off all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on them, and neuertheleſſe vpbraiding vs with ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they muſt needes take vs to be very fooles, not onely in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to ſwimme againſt the ſtreame, but alſo deſiring promotion, whereas we abandon all the likelieſt meanes of attayning thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Or let theſe things pleade for vs as they may, yet becauſe my ſelfe by report am moſt condemned by name, for trauelling in the humor of ſeeking ſuperioritie, I muſt here craue a fauorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from the reader of my intents, for laying downe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars following, being inforced thereunto by the neceſſitie of my owne purgation.</p>
                  <p>When the ſodalitie, or clergie aſſociation (ſo earneſtly inueyed

                     </hi> in Flaunders, and in ſeuerall places of the Apologie) was firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be erected, there were of that companie who labored me, that I would not refuſe to accept of the ſuperioritie: but can any one ſay, that euer I graunted thereunto? Maiſter <hi>Standiſh,</hi> one of the chiefeſt promotors at that time of the ſayd Sodalitie, and whoſe teſtimonie is freeſt from ſuſpition (being now become an aduerſary thereunto) can witnes no, and that I ſtill inſiſted to haue the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour choſen by two third parts of ſuch, as ſhould vnite themſelues for the inſtitution of the ſayd Sodalitie. Againe, to the end that the Superior might this way be choſen, I named fiue or ſixe auncient Prieſts, out of which the election (as I thought might well be made; offering beſide to contribute largely towards the taking and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of a houſe, for the vſe of the ſayd Sodality, ſo as they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt me, and make choyſe of an other.</p>
                  <p>Now if the precedent refuſall and offer do not cleere me of being deſirous of ſuperioritie, becauſe the one may be interpreted for an externall ſhew of humilitie only, and both diſſembled by me, to the end to draw them the more cunningly onward to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing of their purpoſe, of making me the ſuperiour: yet ſurely the ſpeeches which I vſed to Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> himſelfe about the ſame matter, will (I hope) free me with all men. Not long before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting of the new authoritie, Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> dealt earneſtly with me, that I would deſiſt from making or furthering any innouation through the erecting of the Sodalitie, affirming, that it argued an ill affected humor in me, to intreate others (for ſo he ſayd, he vnderſtood that I did, though in truth it was not ſo) to be of the Sodalitie, whereof my ſelfe was deſigned the head. Whereupon, I then preſently gaue him my word to be his bondman, if euer I accepted thereof; and yeelded him harty thanks for his ſpeeches, as hauing giuen me a ſufficient cauſe by them, to deny all my friends for euer taking vpon me the office, by how many ſoeuer the ſame might be importuned, and layd vpon me: which I truſt is ſo plaine and ſincere a diſproofe of that which is imputed vnto me, as it can admit no exception.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, when Maiſter <hi>Biſhop</hi> and Maiſter <hi>Charnock</hi> were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to go to <hi>Rome</hi> for giuing his Holines to vnderſtand what kind of gouernment the Cardinall Protector had inſtituted in our country, and how inconuenient the ſame was in many reſpects, and withall to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:16974:158"/> manifeſt vnto him the lack of Biſhops, which our yonger Catholicks had for the miniſtring of the ſacrament of Confirmation; and how greatly that benefit was deſired by many, I requeſted Maiſter <hi>Biſhop,</hi> that if they ſhould winne his Holines to graunt Biſhops, that in no ſort he would name me for any, aſſuring him, that if I thought he would, I ſhould neither be willing he went the iourney, nor would contribute a penie thereunto. To ſpeake yet more fooliſhly, finding my ſelfe not ſo ſtrong as I did deſire againſt all ſuch temptations, and willing to ſtrengthen my ſelfe more, I enioyned my ſelfe a yeres pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (as the day of Iudgement will declare) for the better ſubduing of them, which ſpirituall taske I performed, and found (God be euer thanked for his infinite mercies) long before the penance expired, that holie feare and hatred of like dignities, as I would not, nor I hope yet will ſtoupe to the ground to take vp the beſt Biſhoprick in the Chriſtian world with the charge. Small reaſon therefore had our Arch-prieſt to write as he did of me, and to diuulge the copy of his letter, namely, <hi>that I was a man clowded in my vnderstanding, if not</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In his Letter to Maiſter Hebborne of the 2. of March. 1599.</note> 
                     <hi>cloyed about my heart with too many fumes of ambition:</hi> And as little cauſe alſo haue many others (who percha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce leſſe know me) to prattle and inlarge their backbitings of one, as they do.</p>
                  <p>Further, if there be any Prieſt, or lay perſon in <hi>England,</hi> with whome, at any time I haue conferred about deriuing Superiority to my ſelfe, let him not ſpare to publiſh whatſoeuer I ſayd vnto him: but I thinke there is not that creature liuing which can charge me with any ſuch matter.</p>
                  <p>Of the otherſide, if either Father <hi>Parſons</hi> or our Arch-prieſt wrote the Epiſtle of <hi>pious griefe</hi> (as few doubt but one of them did) it is ſtrange to ſee the praiſes they deliuer of them ſelues. And as for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parſons</hi> it is noted, that he writeth no booke, diſcourſe, nor ſcarſe any letter of theſe ſtirres, wherein he doth not make mention of the Colledges he erected, or recount ſome other good act of his owne. Amongſt many, the man is thought to be ill neighbored, in that he is thus driuen to praiſe himſelfe, and few do thinke it religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous modeſtie, to farſe bookes with their owne commendations, and to ſet them forth in other mens names: an exerciſe, that neuer any Saint or humble man practiſed. By which courſe of his, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his dealings it is vehemently ſuſpected, leſt he direct his labours to the making of himſelfe popularly famous, and prepare the way to a Cardinals hat.</p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:16974:158"/>
                  <p>By the erecting and managing of the Colledges, he commeth to haue ſtore of money for euery expence, which otherwiſe he was like to faile of, nor could he ſpend fiue or ſixe crownes a weeke (as by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible relation he doth) in poſtage for Letters only. Againe, the ſame imployment and care of his in erecting and prouiding maintenance for the Colledges, ſerueth his turne for liuing in places of concourſe, here, there, and euery where, but in a colledge of his order. A libertie, which himſelfe many yeares ſince ſo hartily deſired, as he perſwaded ſome Prieſts to write to his Generall, how greatly it concerned the common cauſe, and the good of our whole Nation, that he occupied himſelfe in the affaires thereof, and liued abroade in the world, where the doing of moſt good ſhould demaund his preſence. Moreouer, by this oportunitie, and by hauing the Colledges vnder his owne go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, he inioyeth fitteſt meanes of picking out the fineſt wits of our Students, and furniſhing his owne Societie with them. A ſeruice not vngratefull, and which increaſeth his reputation with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and other chiefe perſons of the Societie. In briefe, through theſe meanes alſo, and for that he preſumeth to be able to do much (poore man that he is) in making our next King or ſucceſſor to her Maieſtie, he getteth acquaintance with men of State, Princes, and Kings, and entreth conference with them about the ſame. An affaire of no ſmall contentation to the outward man (whom he is thought not as yet to haue fully caſt off) and as potent and forward a help, as ordinarily any can be, of working his owne aduancement, and of gaining a ſcarlet cap. Theſe, and other like reſpects are ſuſpected to be the ends his trauels tend vnto, and the cauſe of ſuch a ſuſpition, ſeemeth doubtleſſe to be ſtrong. For if he ſincerely intended the good of our Church, and the increaſe of learning, he would not haue dealt with one of the ancienteſt Prieſts of our Nation, about the diſſoluing of the Colledge at <hi>Reames,</hi> nor would he haue ſuppreſſed the Lectures of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at <hi>Doway,</hi> whereby in ſhort time, through the diſcontinuance of the ſtudie, and practiſe of ſchole diuinitie, we ſhall haue no one of our ſecular Clergie fit to reade, or grounded in the facultie, but all eſteeme and helps that way, muſt come from the Ieſuites, a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to them, and diſhonor to our Clergie. Further if Father <hi>Parſons</hi> affected to haue our Seminary Prieſts learned (a thing more requiſite in the ſecular, then in the Religious) neither he, nor any other Ieſuit-Rector of the Colledges, would ſend away the young Prieſts (if they
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:16974:159"/> reſolued not to be Ieſuites, or did not ſhew themſelues zealous for them) before the finiſhing of their whole courſe. Neither would they vpon diſlike, turne ſufficient able wits for the ſtudie of ſchole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to poſitiue diuinitie. In few words, if the credit of ſecular Prieſts, or the good of many were ſought for, and not rather the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of all things to the Ieſuites more ſpeciall reputation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement, how could Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> and ſome other Engliſh Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, make a <hi>Monipolium,</hi> ingroſſing all things into their owne hands, ſo much as no Prieſt in our country, can ſend ouer his friend (how perfectly ſoeuer he know him to be fit) to any of the Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, except the Ieſuites be the meane and doers thereof, or one other, whome they moſt abſolutely direct, or rather rule, as the maiſter doth the ſeruant? Vndoubtedly this was not the cuſtome whiles good Doctor <hi>Allen</hi> was Preſident, nor yet whiles he liued Cardinall: and if ſuch policies, and ſeeking to ſway all things (this latter being a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of higheſt ambition) do long ſtand, or redound to the authors credit in the end, many are miſtaken, who rather feare theſe ſayings of holy ſcripture to be thereby the ſooner exemplified: <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendam ſapientes in austutia eorum, &amp; depoſuit potentes de ſede &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultauit</hi>

                  <p>An other thing, which the Author of the Apollogie obiecteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<note place="margin">Fol. 99.</note> me in particular, and whereof our Archprieſt alſo would make<note place="margin">In his Letter to me vnda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Sir, I admoniſh you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, &amp;c.</note> a hard prognoſtication, is <hi>for that I had left the religious order of the Carthuſians.</hi> No doubt they carry a good will to diſcredit me, and the terme, ſcope, drift of the exception, do make it euident. Yea, ſome of their ſpeciall fauorites (whome I can name) haue ſo earneſtly labored to wound me for this cauſe in the conceits of my beſt friends, as they haue ſpared no perſwaſion to withdrawe their affection and good opinion from me.

                     <hi>into England, and the Cardinall ſoone after dying, he ioyned with an other of his owne humor, that had left an other religion, namely the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thugeans, and they two with ſome few other determined to make a new Hierarchie of their owne, calling it an aſſociation of Clergie men with two Superiours as it were Archbiſhops, the one for the South, and the other for the North.</hi> The vntruths that abound in the Apollogy, are very many, equall to the number of the leaues, or perhaps of the pages, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding either. Amongſt which rable, the paſſage recited, hudleth vp
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:16974:159"/> foure fayles in one. For neither did Maiſter <hi>Muſh</hi> after his returne into <hi>England</hi> ioyne himſelfe with me, neither did we two with ſome few others, determine to make the <hi>Hierachie</hi> mentioned, and leſſe to make the ſame with two Superiours, and leaſt of all, to make theſe two Superiours as it were Archbiſhops, the one, for the South, the other for the North. The falcitie of euery member of this quadrible auowance, appeareth manifeſt in this onely, for that I neuer ſaw Maiſter <hi>Muſh</hi> nor he me, nor had any conference each with other by letters, or meſſengers after his arriuall from <hi>Rome,</hi> vntill ſome fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night before the comming ouer of his Holines Breue in confirmation of the Arch-prieſts Authoritie, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tweluemonths after the firſt inſtitution thereof. So that, neither ſeeing Maiſter <hi>Muſh,</hi> nor hauing any correſponde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with him, nor he with me, during the whole time that the aſſociation was in ſpeech, nor in many yeares before, how can it be ſayd with any truth, that he ioyned with me, or that we two determined to ordaine a new <hi>Hierarchie</hi> with two Superiours, &amp; theſe to be as Archbiſhops? Further, ſo many as euer heard me talke of the Sodalitie, or aſſociation intended, knew that none in <hi>England</hi> more miſliked the making either of two Superiours, or of certaine other ordinances then my ſelfe, and therefore the error was very great in affirming that we ioyned in that, wherein we were moſt contrary. But to let theſe paſſe, and come to the maine point.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe that I verily thought to haue bin a <hi>Carthuſian,</hi> and was in probation with them full neere eleuen months: I acknowledge further, that I reſolued on that ſtate of life in the exerciſe vnder father <hi>Cullume</hi> the Ieſuite then reſident in <hi>Louane,</hi> when I was about ſome three or foure and twentie yeres old. But what, did I euer make a vow of religion, or was otherwiſe obliged by any law of God, or man, to continue that ſtate? No, my vpbrayders, nor any other whoſoeuer can ſay it. For what cauſe then do they lay this as a reproch vnto me? Was my conuerſation miſliked during my being with them, or was I put from them? I hope none will be ſo impudent as to auerre it, there being ſome liuing at this day, who can witnes that the Prior was hartily grieued for my departure. What then was the cauſe why I did not continue? I may alleage ſicknes, for that I was long ſick in the order, and ſo remayned after, till I was Prieſted, and returned to <hi>England.</hi> Likewiſe I may alleage a mightie oppreſſion of ſleepe, not remoueable by any meanes that could be wrought or thought on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:16974:160"/> But neither of theſe impediments moued me to leaue the order. I could neuer learne to ſing nor tune ſixe notes, although I had du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my ſtay with them, the change of ſixe teachers, ſo little willing was the Prior and the Couaunt to leaue me. Father <hi>Slade,</hi> one that had bin of the Queenes Chappell, &amp; taught the Counteſſe of <hi>Oxford</hi> to ſing, was my laſt teacher, and who after long paines and tryall, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered my vnaptnes to the Prior in theſe tearmes, That he could teach a Cow to bellow in tune, as ſoone as me to ſing in tune.</p>
                  <p>Further, my ſtate of body, and vnaptnes to ſing was ſuch, that two of the Senior Monks of the houſe, aduiſed me to content my ſelfe with an other ſtate of life, namely, to take Prieſthood and go into <hi>England:</hi> Yea, Father <hi>Cullume</hi> who was priuy to all the motions that induced me to make choyſe of the Carthuſian life (which was chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my impediment of ſpeech, for that I thought my ſelfe thereby fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a contemplatiue, then an actiue life) wrote me a Letter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading me (vnderſtanding the difficulties I trauelled in, by relation of others, and not from my ſelfe) to come forth, and betake my ſelfe to ſome other ſtate of life.</p>
                  <p>Now this being the truth, what cauſe hath father <hi>Parſons,</hi> or our Arch-prieſt to twite me with leauing the <hi>Carthuſians?</hi> Verily if fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parſons</hi> were the ſetter downe of this exception againſt me in the Apologie, and that the ſame was not added to the copy by father <hi>Garnet</hi> or Maiſter <hi>Blackwell</hi> (the ouerſeers of the worke, and vnto whome father <hi>Parſons</hi> gaue authoritie to adde, and detract what they thought good therein) I wiſh that he would remember the ſpeeches which himſelfe vſed to me in <hi>Roane,</hi> and thereupon correct his bad nature. For there, falling in talke with me after my baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he told me, he vnderſtood, that I had ſome motion of entring into Religion, a courſe which he thought not good for me, becauſe he had learned how much I was inclined, and cumbred with melancholy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aduiſed me not to change my ſtate of life. So that for him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in ſo ſpitefull a manner againſt me, for not perſeuering in that ſtate of life, the like, which himſelfe dehorted me from, and gaue his reaſon for the ſame, argueth both the want of good nature in him, and of honeſtie. But their anger being ſhewed, let vs ſee how Diuines, and the Canoniſts cenſure the caſe. Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">22 q. 189. art. 4. ad 1<hi rend="sup">m</hi>.</note> writeth, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius eſt intrare religionem animo probandi, quam penitus non intrare,</hi> It is better, or of more merite, to enter into religion, with a mind to make

Which if it be true, as no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued author denyeth, then why doth Father <hi>Parſons,</hi> Maiſter <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> and ſome other of their complices, impute my fact a fault vnto me, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> (receiued of all men in the ſame) preferreth the doing before the omiſſion, or the not doing thereof.

Which if it be ſo, as I thinke my diſcreditors will not gaineſay, then the ſame cauſe concurring, as it did in ampleſt manner, in reſpect I was not only ſome moneths ſick in the order, but ſo continued a yeare and more after, and did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, vntill I had bin ſome while in <hi>England.</hi> Yea it was miſdoubted, leaſt my diſeaſe, being an agew with a ſwelling, and voyding bloud at my mouth, would in ſhort ſpace haue ended my life, if I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued fiſh dyet, as of neceſſitie remayning in the order, I muſt haue done. Neuertheleſſe, neither this, or any other weakenes, or mightieſt oppreſſion of ſleepe, was the chiefe cauſe, whereupon I left the order, but my vnaptnes, or truer, the impoſſibilitie, I trauelled in for euer, learning to ſing, was that, which moſt of all diſcomforted me to tye my ſelfe, becauſe being profeſſed and Prieſted, I was bound by the rules of the religion, to ſing Maſſe, when my weeke came by turnes, and lightly ſome verſe alone, which I could neuer attaine to. This was the principall let, this the cauſe, which I tooke, and ſo did Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Allen</hi> of good memorie, Doctor <hi>Stapleton,</hi> Father <hi>Cullume,</hi> with others, to be a moſt reaſonable and iuſt cauſe, or rather an inforcing compulſion of leauing that holie and moſt religious order. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> writeth, <hi>Quis cognouit ſenſum Domini?</hi> Who hath knowne the purpoſe of our Lord? I hope he inſpired the motion whereupon I made the tryall, and I truſt alſo it was not againſt his good pleaſure nor ingratitude, or inconſtancie in me (finding my ſelfe vnfit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede) to leaue the ſame, after tryall and experience made of my diſabilitie. To conclude, whatſoeuer my vpbrayders are pleaſed to write or report of me, I would not for a million (looking vpon the inferiour and ſecond cauſes of things) but that I had changed my purpoſe, conſidering that by my returne into <hi>England,</hi> my father, brothers and ſiſters became all Catholicks, which morally other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, was vnlikely, and moſt of them haue ſithence indured impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment for the cauſe, and my father ended his life in Gloſter ioale for the ſame. Againe ſince that time, which is now ſeauen and twentie yeares paſt or thereabouts, I haue felt that incombrance of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, as God knoweth, what effect it would haue wrought in me, if I had bin ſequeſtred from companie, and liued a ſolitary contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue
